# MemoX Documentation

> Target architecture note: `Either<Failure, T>` / `fpdart` references describe MemoX's intended
> error/result contract style. If the project has not yet adopted `fpdart`, do not add it during
> ordinary feature implementation. First run an approved dependency/API migration task, or use the
> existing repository error/result pattern until that migration is approved.

This folder is the **`docs/` subtree** of MemoX, a local-first Flutter flashcard learning app.

Project-root files such as `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` intentionally live outside this folder.

## Before implementation

Read these in order:

1. `CLAUDE.md` at project root.
2. `AGENTS.md` at project root.
3. Related business, wireframe, design, database, architecture, state, UI/UX and contract docs.
4. Related source files.

Do not implement from assumption when repo contracts already exist.

## Current V1 scope guard

The authoritative V1 scope guard is the Deferred / Future / Rejected register in
`docs/project-management/wbs.md` (§6) plus the capability table in
`docs/business/system/overview.md`. (The former standalone gate file
`v1-implementation-scope-2026-05-29.md` no longer exists.)

Important V1 decisions:

| Feature                                        | V1 status          |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Flashcard history screen                       | Future Proposal    |
| Global search screen (folders/decks/flashcards) | Implemented        |
| Global search: tags + recent + popular         | Future Proposal    |
| Full onboarding flow                           | Future Proposal    |
| Inline/scope-local search patterns             | V1 guideline       |
| Strong zero-content empty states + restore CTA | V1 scope           |
| Empty-scope matrix Tier 1                      | V1 P0              |
| Bury / suspend                                 | V1 after migration |
| Tag domain cleanup                             | V1/P1              |

## Agent instruction

- Do not create routes for Future Proposal screens.
- Do not wire dead links to Future Proposal screens.
- Do not implement migration-required behavior unless the migration is explicitly part of the task.
- Do not add product behavior without updating business docs, wireframes, matrix, decision table and
  tests.
