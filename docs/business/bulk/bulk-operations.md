# Bulk Operations

> **Status: Partial — backend bulk delete is implemented; selection-mode FE and the other bulk
> actions remain Specified / Future.**

## Purpose

Selection-based export exists today, but other multi-card workflows (delete a page of bad cards,
retag, move to another deck) require one-by-one operations. This doc specs the full bulk operations
set on flashcards.

Folders and decks are not covered here; they typically have low cardinality and single-item
operations suffice.

## Selection mode

Flashcard list (`/library/deck/:deckId/flashcards`) enters selection mode via:

| Trigger                            | Behavior                                      |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Long-press a card                  | Enters selection mode with that card selected |
| Toolbar "Select" action            | Enters selection mode with no cards selected  |
| "Select all" within selection mode | Selects every visible (filtered) card         |

Exit selection mode via:

- Toolbar "Cancel" action.
- System back gesture.
- Deselecting last card (returns to normal mode).

## Selection UI

| Element                    | Behavior                                                       |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Card tap in selection mode | Toggle selection                                               |
| Counter                    | "{n} selected" in app bar                                      |
| Select-all checkbox        | Selects all rows matching current filters                      |
| Action bar                 | Bottom or top bar with bulk action icons (depends on platform) |

Selection state is ephemeral (in-memory). Navigating away or filter change clears it.

## Supported bulk actions

| Action              | Behavior                                                                                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bulk delete         | Confirmation → delete selected cards in one transaction. Cascade applies; missing IDs are skipped and reported. |
| Bulk move to deck   | Picker → select target deck → move selected cards. Validates target deck mode.             |
| Bulk add tag(s)     | Tag input/picker → append tags to each selected card (deduped).                            |
| Bulk remove tag(s)  | Tag picker (limited to tags present on selection) → remove from each.                      |
| Bulk suspend        | Set `is_suspended = true` for each. See `docs/business/study-actions/bury-suspend.md`.     |
| Bulk unsuspend      | Set `is_suspended = false` for each.                                                       |
| Bulk bury           | Set `buried_until` to tomorrow's local midnight for each.                                  |
| Bulk unbury         | Clear `buried_until` for each.                                                             |
| Bulk reset progress | Confirmation → reset `flashcard_progress` (box=1, counters=0, due=now). Attempts retained. |
| Bulk export         | Build CSV/Excel from selected (already specified in `docs/business/export/export.md`).     |

## Transactional semantics

All bulk operations MUST run in a single transaction:

- Atomicity: all applied changes commit together or not at all.
- Performance: a single transaction for 1000 row update beats 1000 transactions.

If a bulk operation fails mid-transaction, the entire transaction rolls back and the UI shows an
error. No partial commit.

One defined exception to "operate on every selected ID": selected cards that no longer exist at
execution time are **skipped and reported** ("X cards no longer exist and were skipped") — the
operation still applies atomically to all surviving cards in one transaction. Missing rows are
the ONLY skip condition; any other per-row failure aborts and rolls back the whole transaction.

## Confirmation requirements

| Action               | Confirmation                                                                    |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bulk delete          | Required; "Delete {n} cards? This cannot be undone."                            |
| Bulk reset progress  | Required; "Reset SRS progress for {n} cards? They will become due immediately." |
| Bulk move            | Not required (reversible via move-back); show toast with undo for 5s            |
| Bulk suspend         | Not required; toast with undo for 5s                                            |
| Bulk unsuspend       | Not required; toast with undo for 5s                                            |
| Bulk bury            | Not required; toast with undo for 5s                                            |
| Bulk add/remove tags | Not required; toast with undo for 5s                                            |
| Bulk export          | Not required; goes to share sheet (user can cancel there)                       |

Toast-undo MUST genuinely revert via inverse transaction.

## Move operation rules

- Target deck must exist.
- Target deck must be in a folder whose mode allows decks (existing rule).
- Cards moved retain `flashcard_progress` (SRS state preserved across deck moves).
- Cards moved retain `flashcard_tags` (tags global by name, so they remain).
- `sort_order` recomputed: appended to end of target deck. The undo path MUST snapshot each
  card's original `(deck_id, sort_order)` before the move so toast-undo can restore the exact
  previous positions (required by the "real inverse operation" rule below).
- Source deck card count decreases; target deck card count increases.
- If target == source: no-op, dismiss with toast.

## Filter interaction

- Select-all selects cards matching current filter (status + tag).
- After a bulk action that changes filter-relevant state (e.g., bulk suspend while filter = "
  Active"), affected cards disappear from view. Selection clears.
- Bulk operations always run on the actual selected ID list, NOT re-evaluating filter at execution
  time. (Snapshot the IDs at action confirmation.)

## Edge cases

| Case                                                                   | Behavior                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User selects 1000+ cards                                               | Allowed. Transaction handles it. Show progress indicator for slow ops.                      |
| Some selected cards deleted by another session (rare; single-user app) | Transaction proceeds for surviving cards; report "X cards no longer exist and were skipped" |
| Bulk move target deck is empty                                         | Allowed. Cards become its first cards.                                                      |
| Bulk move target deck reaches a max size constraint (none today)       | Reject with explanation if such constraint is added                                         |
| Undo within toast window, but transaction not yet acknowledged         | Queue undo; apply when first transaction completes                                          |
| Two bulk actions in rapid succession                                   | UI prevents queue overlap; second action waits for first to finalize                        |

## Rules

- Selection mode is ephemeral and screen-scoped.
- Bulk action transaction MUST be atomic.
- Operation runs on selected IDs snapshot, not re-derived from filter.
- Destructive bulk actions (delete, reset progress) MUST require confirmation.
- Non-destructive bulk actions show toast with undo.
- Undo MUST be a real inverse operation, not a "best-effort" stub.
- Bulk operations are account-scoped (no cross-account move possible).
- Bulk "reset progress" MUST set `last_reset_at = now` on each affected `flashcard_progress` row (
  see `docs/business/history/card-history.md`). It MUST NOT delete attempts.
- Bulk delete V1 is the only backend bulk operation currently implemented; selection-mode FE and
  the non-delete actions remain future work.

## Performance

- 1000 rows update: typically < 1 second. Profile before declaring acceptable.
- Indexes on `flashcards(id)`, `flashcards(deck_id)`, `flashcard_progress(flashcard_id)`,
  `flashcard_tags(flashcard_id)` already exist; verify.
- Avoid per-row reads inside the transaction; use bulk SQL (`UPDATE ... WHERE id IN (?, ?, ...)`).
- Watch out for SQLite parameter limit (~999 by default); chunk IN clauses if needed.

## Required UI states

- Selection mode entry/exit animations.
- Counter visible.
- Action bar with available bulk actions.
- Confirmation dialog for destructive.
- Toast with undo for reversible.
- Progress indicator for long operations (> 1 sec).

## Agent rule

- Do NOT split bulk operations into separate transactions per row.
- Do NOT skip undo for non-destructive bulk actions.
- Bulk move MUST respect folder content mode rules (target folder must be `decks` or `unlocked`).
- Bulk reset progress MUST NOT delete attempts.
- Toast undo MUST genuinely revert; do not show fake undo button.
- Filter-driven "Select all" snapshots IDs at the moment of selection, not at action execution.
