# SRS Review

> **Status: Target — Partial Migration Required.** Box transition logic itself is implementable
> today on `flashcard_progress` and `study_attempts`. However, persisting per-attempt box transitions
> for history requires the following columns from `docs/database/schema-contract.md` §Pending schema
> changes:
>
> - `study_attempts.box_before INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`
> - `study_attempts.box_after INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0`
>
> `GradeAttemptUseCase` MUST populate both columns on every insert. Pre-migration rows are
> backfilled with `0`. Blocks (until migration): card history timeline, study result box-change
> aggregates, progress screen box distribution from attempts.

## Source files to inspect

- `lib/domain/**progress**`
- `lib/domain/**study**`
- `lib/data/**progress**`
- `lib/data/**study**`
- `lib/data/datasources/local/tables/flashcard_progress_table.dart`
- `lib/data/datasources/local/tables/study_attempts_table.dart`
- `lib/data/repositories/study_repo_impl_helpers.dart` (`_reviewOutcome`, canonical owner of box
  transitions at finalization).
- `lib/domain/study/srs_interval_policy.dart` (`SrsIntervalPolicy`, current runtime owner of
  interval values).
- `lib/data/repositories/study_repo_impl_mapping_helpers.dart` (`_intervalForBox`, repository
  adapter to `SrsIntervalPolicy`).
- `lib/domain/study/usecases/study_usecases.dart` (session creation, empty-scope checks, and
  in-session answer orchestration; the legacy `lib/domain/srs/box_intervals.dart` and
  `lib/domain/srs/box_transition.dart` files do NOT exist).

## Data

SRS state is stored in `flashcard_progress`.

Important fields:

- `flashcard_id`
- `current_box` (1-8)
- `review_count`
- `lapse_count`
- `last_result`
- `last_studied_at` (UTC epoch ms)
- `due_at` (UTC epoch ms)

## Rules

- Box range is 1 to 8 inclusive.
- New flashcard starts at `current_box = 1` with `due_at = now`.
- Due card: `due_at <= now`.
- Deleted flashcards must not appear in due list (foreign key enforced).
- Review result must update progress through domain/use case/repository flow.
- UI must not update SRS box directly.
- SRS review must use study session tables.
- Do not add separate review tables unless schema change is explicitly approved.

## Review results

See `docs/business/glossary.md` for result definitions.

| Result           | When it applies                                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `initial_passed` | Correct on first attempt for this card in this session |
| `perfect`        | Correct without any retry within the session cycle     |
| `recovered`      | Correct after at least one retry within the session    |
| `forgot`         | Failed (used up retries or explicit "I don't know")    |

## Box transition table

This is the authoritative transition contract. The box transition is computed at session
finalization by `_reviewOutcome` in `lib/data/repositories/study_repo_impl_helpers.dart` (reached
via `FinalizeStudySessionUseCase` → `StudyRepository.finalizeSession` → `_commitSrs`); the
in-session `Answer*UseCase` family in `lib/domain/study/usecases/study_usecases.dart` only records
attempts and re-queues failed cards. Implementation must match this table. There is no standalone
`box_transition.dart` file at present.

Per-card result classification (`forgot` / `recovered` / `perfect`) is shared with the Study Result
breakdown: `forgot` = no passing attempt this session (box → 1, lapse +1); `recovered` = at least
one passing attempt but not all `correct` (box stays, no lapse); `perfect` = every attempt
`correct` (box + 1). Note: because failed cards are re-queued until passed within a mode, a
normally-completed session never finalizes a card with zero passing attempts, so `forgot` is
currently unreachable through the standard study flow (see
`docs/checklist/wireframe-code-parity-assessment.md`).

| Current box | Result           | Next box | Next due              |
|-------------|------------------|----------|-----------------------|
| n (1-7)     | `perfect`        | n + 1    | now + interval[n + 1] |
| n (1-7)     | `initial_passed` | n + 1    | now + interval[n + 1] |
| 8           | `perfect`        | 8 (stay) | now + interval[8]     |
| 8           | `initial_passed` | 8 (stay) | now + interval[8]     |
| n (1-8)     | `recovered`      | n (stay) | now + interval[n]     |
| n (1-8)     | `forgot`         | 1        | now + interval[1]     |

## Interval table

Intervals are currently defined by `SrsIntervalPolicy` in
`lib/domain/study/srs_interval_policy.dart`; finalization reaches the same source through
`_intervalForBox` in `lib/data/repositories/study_repo_impl_mapping_helpers.dart`, and Learning
Settings renders that same runtime source. The doc-level table below remains a pending product/docs
contract; Prompt 12/13 identified that it differs from runtime. Until the interval-ladder product
decision is made, **code owns runtime behavior** and this table must not be silently rewritten as
resolved.

| Box | Interval | Approx   | Rationale                                                                |
|-----|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | 1 day    | 1 day    | Same-day-next retry; force overnight memory consolidation before re-test |
| 2   | 2 days   | 2 days   | Gentle stretch                                                           |
| 3   | 3 days   | 3 days   | Gentle stretch                                                           |
| 4   | 4 days   | 4 days   | Gentle stretch                                                           |
| 5   | 5 days   | 5 days   | Gentle stretch                                                           |
| 6   | 12 days  | ~2 weeks | First larger jump after solid short-term retention                       |
| 7   | 30 days  | 1 month  | Long-term retention check                                                |
| 8   | 60 days  | 2 months | Maintenance                                                              |

Design intent: avoid overwhelming the user. Box 1 → 5 increases linearly by one day, so each
successive review feels like a small step. Larger jumps reserved for boxes 6+ where the card is
already stable.

When implementation differs from this table, record the mismatch as a product/docs decision and
update whichever side is chosen in the same commit. The current mismatch is tracked in
`docs/checklist/product-decisions-pending-2026-05-29.md`.

## Counter rules

| Counter        | When incremented                    |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| `review_count` | Every finalized review (any result) |
| `lapse_count`  | Only on `forgot` result             |

## In-session self-grade V1

The current Study Session recall shell records answer attempts during the session:

- Reveal the current card.
- Tap `Forgot` or `Got it`.
- Persist a `study_attempts` row and set `study_session_items.answered_at`.
- Do not update `flashcard_progress` yet.

This keeps progress commits and box transitions in the finalization path, while the active session can move to the next unanswered item immediately.

## Finalization

At session finalization:

1. Persist all attempts (already done during session).
2. Compute final result per item based on attempt history and flow.
3. Update progress: `current_box`, `review_count`, `lapse_count`, `last_result`, `last_studied_at`,
   `due_at`.
4. Update session status to `completed`.

All steps must be in a single transaction. See `docs/database/storage-boundaries.md`.

On failure:

- Set session status to `failed_to_finalize`.
- Do not partially update progress.
- Allow retry.

## Due query contract

The due query must:

- Filter by `due_at <= now`.
- Exclude deleted flashcards (foreign key, but enforce in query).
- Order by `due_at ASC` then `current_box ASC`.
- Scope correctly (deck / folder recursive / all).

## Agent rule

Any SRS behavior change must update:

- `lib/data/repositories/study_repo_impl_helpers.dart` (`_reviewOutcome`) and/or
  `lib/domain/study/srs_interval_policy.dart` (`SrsIntervalPolicy`) plus its repository adapter
  `lib/data/repositories/study_repo_impl_mapping_helpers.dart` (`_intervalForBox`)
- This doc (transition table and/or interval table)
- `docs/business/study/study-flow.md` if flow changes
- Decision table S6-S10
- Targeted tests in `test/domain/srs/**`

  in-session answer orchestration (`AnswerFlashcardUseCase`, `AnswerCurrentModeBatchUseCase`,
  `AnswerCurrentModeItemGradesBatchUseCase`, `AnswerCurrentMatchModeBatchUseCase`). It records
  attempts and re-queues failed cards; final SRS transition is committed later by the data
  repository.
- `lib/domain/study/strategy/study_strategy.dart` + `study_mode_strategy.dart` +
  `study_strategy_factory.dart` — per-mode behavior including transition rules.

- `lib/data/repositories/study_repo_impl.dart` + helpers (`study_repo_impl_helpers.dart`,
  `study_repo_impl_mapping_helpers.dart`, `study_repo_impl_models.dart`) — finalization write path;
  `_reviewOutcome` computes final per-card result/box transition and `_intervalForBox` delegates
  runtime due intervals to `SrsIntervalPolicy`.
