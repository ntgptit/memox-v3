# Bury and Suspend

> **Status: Implemented (P0-2).** Schema v10 added `flashcard_progress.buried_until INTEGER NULL`
> and `flashcard_progress.is_suspended BOOL NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` (+ index
`idx_flashcard_progress_eligibility`). Implemented: bury/suspend/unbury/unsuspend use cases +
> repository persistence; study-batch + due-count filtering (excludes suspended and currently-buried;
> expired bury re-enters); empty-scope variants `studyEmpty_allBuried` / `studyEmpty_allSuspended`;
> the card-actions bottom sheet (Edit / Bury / Suspend) reachable via the overflow trigger in all five
> study mode views (review/match/guess/recall/fill) + the session app bar; and **active-session
removal** — burying/suspending the current card abandons it (no attempt, SRS preserved), removes it
> from the queue so it does not reappear in the session, and advances or finalizes the session (
`DropCurrentStudyItemUseCase` → `StudyRepo.dropCurrentItemFromSession`).
>
> **Still pending (separate tasks):** undo re-insert of a buried/suspended card into the *active*
> session (undo currently reverts the progress state only); flashcard-list state badges + status
> filter chips; bulk suspend/unsuspend; unsuspend from the flashcard list; optional long-press
> shortcut alongside the overflow trigger.

## Purpose

When a user encounters a card mid-session that they don't want to study right now, the only options
today are `forgot` (which resets to box 1, lying to the SRS algorithm) or quit the session. Both
punish the user for normal human behavior. This document specs two escape hatches:

- **Bury**: hide this card for the rest of today. It returns tomorrow as part of normal due/new
  flow.
- **Suspend**: hide this card indefinitely until the user explicitly unsuspends it.

## Data model

Add two fields to `flashcard_progress`:

| Field          | Type         | Default | Meaning                                                                         |
|----------------|--------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `buried_until` | INTEGER NULL | NULL    | UTC epoch ms; card is hidden from study queues while `buried_until > now`.      |
| `is_suspended` | BOOL         | `false` | When true, card is hidden from all study queues regardless of due/buried state. |

Schema migration required (see `docs/database/migration-contract.md`). Adds two columns to
`flashcard_progress` with safe defaults.

Indexes:

- Add to existing index on `flashcard_progress(due_at)` → consider compound index covering
  `is_suspended` and `buried_until` for fast due queries. Verify query plan after migration.

## Bury

### Behavior

When user buries a card during a study session:

1. Set `flashcard_progress.buried_until = midnight + 1 second` in user's local timezone. (Card
   becomes available the next calendar day.)
2. Skip this card in the current session: remove from remaining items queue OR mark item with skip
   flag.
3. Continue session with next item.
4. NO attempt recorded for this bury. SRS state (box, counters) unchanged.

### Where bury appears in UI

| Surface                               | Trigger                                                           |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Study session screen                  | Action menu (e.g., overflow icon on card) → "Bury until tomorrow" |
| Long-press on card during review mode | Optional shortcut                                                 |

Confirmation NOT required (bury is reversible and low-impact). Show inline toast "Buried until
tomorrow" with "Undo" action for 5 seconds.

### Auto-unbury

A card becomes available again when `now >= buried_until`. No background task needed; queries simply
filter.

Due query update:

```sql
WHERE due_at <= now
  AND is_suspended = 0
  AND (buried_until IS NULL OR buried_until <= now)
```

## Suspend

### Behavior

When user suspends a card:

1. Set `flashcard_progress.is_suspended = true`.
2. Card disappears from all study queues immediately (today's due, deck/folder study, today's
   review).
3. SRS state preserved (box, due_at, counters unchanged) so unsuspending resumes from where it was.
4. Card still appears in flashcard list (with suspended badge) and in card history.

### Where suspend appears in UI

| Surface                                                     | Trigger                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Study session screen                                        | Action menu → "Suspend card" |
| Flashcard list (long-press / item menu)                     | "Suspend" action             |
| Card history view (`docs/business/history/card-history.md`) | "Suspend" action             |

Confirmation NOT required, but the toast must show "Suspended" with "Undo" for 5 seconds since the
action is impactful.

### Unsuspend

| Surface                                                                      | Trigger                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Flashcard list, filtered to "Suspended"                                      | Tap item → "Unsuspend"             |
| Suspended cards screen (`/library/deck/:deckId/flashcards?filter=suspended`) | Bulk select → "Unsuspend selected" |
| Single card detail                                                           | "Unsuspend"                        |

On unsuspend:

- `is_suspended = false`.
- Card re-enters due flow normally based on existing `due_at`.
- If `due_at` is in the past (because card was suspended past its due time), it shows as due
  immediately.

## Visibility rules

### Where buried/suspended cards are hidden

- All study queues (deck study, folder study, today's review).
- Due count badges on Dashboard, folder/deck cards.
- "Next due" calculations on empty states.

### Where they remain visible

- Flashcard list (with badge: "Buried until tomorrow" / "Suspended").
- Card history view.
- Tag-filtered views.
- Search results.
- Export (already independent of due state).

## Filters in flashcard list

Add filter chips to flashcard list:

| Filter    | Behavior                                           |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| All       | Default; shows all cards regardless of state       |
| Active    | Hides suspended and currently-buried               |
| Suspended | Only suspended                                     |
| Buried    | Only currently-buried (where `buried_until > now`) |
| Due       | Only currently due (and active)                    |

Filters multiplex with tag filter (see `docs/business/tags/tag-system.md`). Default: All.

## Bulk operations

Both bury and suspend support bulk operations from flashcard list multi-select (see
`docs/business/bulk/bulk-operations.md`):

- Bulk suspend.
- Bulk unsuspend.
- Bulk bury (rarely useful; available for completeness).
- Bulk unbury (same).

## Rules

- Bury and suspend MUST NOT record a `study_attempts` row. They are scheduling actions, not answers.
- Bury and suspend MUST NOT alter `current_box`, `review_count`, `lapse_count`, or `due_at`.
- The due query MUST exclude buried and suspended cards (added filter clause).
- Bury duration is always "until tomorrow's local midnight". No user-configurable bury duration. (
  Anki has flexible bury; we keep it simple.)
- Unsuspending a card whose `due_at` is in the past makes it immediately due. Do not auto-bump
  `due_at` forward.
- Buried/suspended cards still count toward total card counts in deck/folder labels (e.g., "Deck has
  50 cards" includes them). Only DUE counts exclude them.

## Edge cases

| Case                                                                       | Behavior                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Card buried during session, session continues, midnight passes mid-session | Card remains hidden from current session (already removed from queue). New session next day sees it as available.                                 |
| All due cards in a deck are buried                                         | Show empty state "You buried all due cards. They'll return tomorrow." (already covered in `docs/business/study/study-flow.md` empty scope matrix) |
| All cards in a deck suspended                                              | Deck shows "0 cards available" badge but total count still shown. Study refuses with appropriate empty state.                                     |
| Bury then immediately unbury (via toast undo)                              | Clear `buried_until` back to NULL. Re-insert card into current session queue at next position.                                                    |
| Suspend then unsuspend (via toast undo)                                    | Clear `is_suspended = false`. Card remains in current session queue if it was active there; no special action.                                    |
| Card buried, then user deletes the card                                    | Deletion cascades normally; `buried_until` is irrelevant.                                                                                         |
| Card suspended, then deck is deleted                                       | Cascade delete via existing rules.                                                                                                                |
| Bury card during folder study (recursive scope)                            | Bury affects only that card globally. Other decks in folder unaffected.                                                                           |
| Time zone changes while a card is buried                                   | `buried_until` is stored as UTC epoch ms; effective unbury time tracks correctly across timezone changes.                                         |

## Required UI states

| Surface                        | States                                           |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Bury action button             | Always available during session for current card |
| Suspend action button          | Always available during session for current card |
| Bury/suspend toast             | Visible 5s with undo; undo reverts               |
| Flashcard list filter chip     | Visible always; reflects current filter          |
| Suspended/buried badge on card | Visible when card has state                      |
| Bulk select bar                | Includes bury/suspend/unbury/unsuspend actions   |

## Performance

- Due query: existing index on `due_at` plus added filter on `is_suspended` and `buried_until`.
  Expect minor cost. Profile after migration.
- Flashcard list with filter: stream-based via Drift `watch*` query with filter clause.
- Bulk operations: single transaction for all rows.

## Agent rule

- Do NOT implement bury/suspend by deleting `flashcard_progress` rows. State must be preserved for
  unsuspend.
- Do NOT add user-configurable bury durations. Keep it "until tomorrow" only.
- Do NOT introduce a "bury for N days" variant without updating this doc.
- Toast undo MUST revert the state; not implementing undo is a bug.
- Due query MUST be updated in ALL places (deck study, folder study, today, due count badges) —
  search the codebase for `due_at <= now` and update each.
