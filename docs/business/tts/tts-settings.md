# TTS Settings

> **Status: Current V1 global/front-language settings; Target per-language independence.** Current
> settings persist as one Drift-backed row in the `tts_settings` table through `TtsSettingsDao` and
`TtsSettingsRepositoryImpl`. Independent Korean/English setting sets remain Target/Future and must
> not be treated as Current. Per-deck TTS gating policy depends on `decks.target_language` from
`docs/database/schema-contract.md` §Pending schema changes.

## Data

Current V1 storage is the Drift `tts_settings` table (Dart table class `TtsSettingsRecords`) through
`TtsSettingsDao` and `TtsSettingsRepositoryImpl`.

The table is a single-row pattern with id = `'default'`.

Status: Current for the global/front-language settings row. Target/Future for independent
per-language settings; do not add separate per-language storage in a normal parity task without an
approved migration/product decision.

Fields:

| Field              | Type      | Constraint                              |
|--------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `id`               | TEXT PK   | Always `'default'` (single-row pattern) |
| `auto_play`        | BOOL      | -                                       |
| `front_language`   | TEXT      | `'korean'` or `'english'`               |
| `rate`             | REAL      | CHECK between 0.3 and 0.7               |
| `pitch`            | REAL      | CHECK between 0.7 and 1.5               |
| `volume`           | REAL      | CHECK between 0.0 and 1.0               |
| `front_voice_name` | TEXT NULL | Voice id from platform                  |

## Supported languages

| Language | Locale tag | Storage value |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Korean   | `ko-KR`    | `korean`      |
| English  | `en-US`    | `english`     |

Default app TTS language: Korean.

When `front_language` storage value is unknown, fall back to Korean.

## Deck-level language gate

Each deck declares a `target_language` (see `docs/business/deck/deck-management.md`). TTS behavior
is gated by this declaration:

| Deck `target_language` | TTS speak action                          | Auto-play                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `korean`               | Enabled, uses `ko-KR` voice from settings | Honors `autoPlay` toggle       |
| `english`              | Enabled, uses `en-US` voice from settings | Honors `autoPlay` toggle       |
| `unsupported`          | Speak button disabled / hidden            | Suppressed silently (no toast) |

This prevents wrong-accent playback (e.g., Vietnamese front spoken with English voice). The
deck-level gate is checked BEFORE the playback policy that restricts side to `front`.

When a deck's `target_language` differs from the app TTS `frontLanguage` setting, the deck's
language wins for that deck's playback. The app setting is a default, not an override.

## Setting ranges and defaults

| Setting          | Min | Max | Default  |
|------------------|-----|-----|----------|
| `rate`           | 0.3 | 0.7 | 0.5      |
| `pitch`          | 0.7 | 1.5 | 1.0      |
| `volume`         | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0      |
| `autoPlay`       | -   | -   | `false`  |
| `frontLanguage`  | -   | -   | `korean` |
| `frontVoiceName` | -   | -   | `null`   |

Source of truth: constants in `TtsSettings` (`minRate`, `maxRate`, `defaultRate`, etc.).

## Normalization rules

- Every write to `rate`, `pitch`, `volume` MUST go through `TtsSettings.normalizeRate`,
  `normalizePitch`, `normalizeVolume`.
- Normalization clamps to `[min, max]` and returns `double`.
- Normalization applies on both read (repository load) and write (DAO save) so corrupt values
  self-heal.

## Voice selection

- Available voices come from the platform via `TtsService.availableVoices(language)`.
- Voices are filtered by language tag.
- `frontVoiceName` stores the platform-specific voice identifier.
- Current V1 has one global/front-language `frontVoiceName`, not per-language voice storage.
- Changing `frontLanguage` MUST clear `frontVoiceName` (via `clearFrontVoice: true` in `copyWith`)
  because the stored voice belongs to the previous front language.
- When the stored voice name is no longer available on the device, the expanded selector falls back
  to System voice and does not crash. Eager validation/remediation on screen open is Target/Future.
- Target/Future per-language voice storage may persist one voice per supported language after the
  independent settings migration exists.

## Playback policy

TTS playback is restricted by `TtsPlaybackPolicy`:

| Card side | Can speak? |
|-----------|------------|
| `front`   | Yes        |
| `back`    | No         |
| `note`    | No         |

Rationale: TTS today is for prompts (front of card). Back/note are user-revealed content and not
spoken.

This restriction is enforced in `SpeakFlashcardUseCase.speakFlashcardSide` via
`_playbackPolicy.canSpeakFlashcardSide(side)`. Do not bypass.

## TTS state

`TtsService.state` is a `Stream<TtsState>`:

| State      | Meaning                     |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| `idle`     | No active playback          |
| `speaking` | Currently speaking          |
| `paused`   | Paused (platform-supported) |
| `error`    | Last operation failed       |

UI components (e.g., `MxSpeakButton`) react to this stream for play/stop state.

## Rules

- TTS settings is a single global/front-language setting set (no independent Korean/English settings
  and no per-deck override yet).
- All settings changes persist immediately on user interaction (no save button).
- Blank text (whitespace-only) MUST NOT trigger speech (`StringUtils.isBlank` guard in
  `SpeakFlashcardUseCase.speakText`).
- Text is trimmed before passing to platform TTS.
- Voice name is trimmed to null on load (empty string → null).
- TTS service is platform-specific (Flutter TTS plugin). Domain layer interacts only via
  `TtsService` interface.
- Auto-play applies only to study session flashcard reveal. Other surfaces use explicit user tap.

## Screen behavior

`AudioSpeechSettingsScreen` (route: `/settings/audio-speech`) renders `SpeechSettingsGroup` which
includes:

- Auto-play toggle.
- Front language picker.
- Voice picker (filtered by current language).
- Rate slider (0.3 → 0.7).
- Pitch slider (0.7 → 1.5).
- Volume slider (0.0 → 1.0).
- Test speak action (sample text).

Loading/error states use shared `Mx*` widgets per UI/UX contract.

## Required UI states

- Loading: while `TtsSettingsNotifier` initial build resolves.
- Error: when repository load fails (rare, since defaults fall back).
- Voice list loading: while `availableVoices` resolves per language.
- Voice list empty: when platform reports zero voices for the language.

## Performance

- Voice list query may be slow on first call per language. Current Settings UI loads voices lazily
  when voice options are expanded.
- Speak action: do not queue multiple speaks. Stop previous before starting next.

## Agent rule

- Do not introduce a separate TTS settings table. Preserve the current `tts_settings` single-row
  pattern unless an approved migration/product decision explicitly changes it.
- Do not bypass `TtsPlaybackPolicy` to speak back/note. If a new playable side is needed, update the
  policy first and document here.
- Do not add per-deck TTS override without updating this doc and schema.
- All slider write paths MUST go through `TtsSettings.normalize*` helpers.
- Changing `frontLanguage` MUST clear `frontVoiceName` (otherwise the stored voice belongs to a
  different language).
