# MemoX Product Overview

## Product

MemoX is a local-first flashcard learning app.

It helps users:

- Manage folders (create, rename, move, delete, reorder).
- Manage decks (create, rename, move, delete, reorder, import, export). Each deck declares a target language.
- Manage flashcards (create, edit, delete, reorder, tag, import, export selected, bulk operations).
- Organize content hierarchically through folders.
- Tag cards and filter inside current card/tag-management surfaces. Study-by-tag remains Blocked/Future in V1.
- Study cards through multiple modes.
- Review due cards via spaced repetition (Leitner 8-box).
- Bury cards until tomorrow or suspend them indefinitely.
- Resume paused sessions from Dashboard.
- See a simple Dashboard streak stat placeholder in V1; full daily goal/streak/reminder engagement remains Future/Target.
- Search the whole Library (folders, decks, flashcards) from a dedicated `/library/search` screen, plus filter inside the current screen scope. Tags-in-search, recent searches, and popular tags remain Future Proposal.
- View per-card history is Future Proposal, not V1 scope.
- Configure audio/speech (TTS) preferences for Korean and English.
- Optionally link a Google account for Drive AppData backup and restore with conflict protection.

Agents must not implement capabilities outside this table without first creating or extending a spec doc. Agents also must not implement rows marked Future Proposal without an explicit promotion: update this table's status AND the corresponding row in the Deferred / Future / Rejected register of `docs/project-management/wbs.md` (§6) in the same commit. (The former gate file `v1-implementation-scope-2026-05-29.md` no longer exists; the WBS register is the promotion record.)

## Product principles

- Local database is the source of truth.
- Login and backup are optional.
- Core learning must work offline.
- UX must be calm, fast, and mobile-first.
- UI must follow MemoX Design System.
- Business rules must live outside widgets.
