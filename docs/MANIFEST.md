# MemoX Documentation Package

Generated: 2026-05-29
Source: github.com/ntgptit/memox-v2
Scope: `docs/` subtree only

This archive contains the **MemoX documentation subtree**. It intentionally does **not** contain
project-root agent entry files.

In the real project layout, the files live like this:

```text
project-root/
├── CLAUDE.md          # AI-agent entry rules, lives at project root
├── AGENTS.md          # agent responsibilities, lives at project root
├── README.md          # project README, lives at project root
├── pubspec.yaml
├── lib/
├── test/
└── docs/              # this package content
    ├── MANIFEST.md
    ├── README.md
    ├── business/
    ├── wireframes/
    ├── database/
    ├── checklist/
    └── ...
```

## Reading order for first-time agents

1. `CLAUDE.md` at project root — read fully, especially Doc-code parity rule and Path convention.
2. `AGENTS.md` at project root — short agent contract.
3. `docs/MANIFEST.md` — this file.
4. `docs/project-management/wbs.md` — delivery plan + §6 Deferred / Future / Rejected register (the V1 scope guard).
5. `docs/business/glossary.md` — domain terms.
6. `docs/business/index.md` — feature map.
7. `docs/business/system/overview.md` — product capability map.
8. `docs/contracts/error-contract.md` — Failure taxonomy target.
9. `docs/contracts/types-catalog.md` — enums and value objects.
10. `docs/contracts/code-style.md` — naming and structure.
11. For any UI mock task: `docs/design/mock-design-index.md`, the matching visual contract under
    `docs/design/screens/`, and the matching wireframe `docs/wireframes/NN-{screen}.md`.

## Current vs Target documentation rule

MemoX docs are allowed to describe both current implementation and target architecture.

Use these labels consistently:

- **Current**: already implemented, or treated as current baseline for documentation purposes.
- **Target**: intended architecture, schema, API, UX, or behavior. Not automatically approved for
  the current sprint.
- **Migration Required**: target behavior that needs schema migration, dependency adoption,
  generated-code update, refactor, or test migration before implementation.
- **Future Proposal**: useful direction, but explicitly out of V1 unless promoted by a later docs
  PR.

AI agents must not delete target architecture only because implementation has not caught up yet.
AI agents also must not implement `Migration Required` or `Future Proposal` behavior unless the task
explicitly promotes it and includes required migration/decomposition work.

## V1 scope decision summary

The V1 scope guard is the Deferred / Future / Rejected register in
`docs/project-management/wbs.md` (§6) plus the capability table in
`docs/business/system/overview.md`. (The former standalone gate file
`v1-implementation-scope-2026-05-29.md` no longer exists.)

| Feature                   | V1 status                | Notes                                                     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Flashcard history screen  | Future Proposal          | Keep docs; hide/disable entry links in V1.                |
| Global search screen      | Implemented (folders/decks/flashcards) | Top-level `/search` (design redesign — bottom search dock); tags section + recent + popular remain Future. |
| Full onboarding flow      | Future Proposal          | V1 uses stronger zero-content empty states + restore CTA. |
| Empty-scope matrix Tier 1 | Approved V1              | Safe to implement from the P0 plan.                       |
| Bury / suspend            | Approved after migration | Must include schema migration.                            |
| Tag domain cleanup        | Approved V1/P1           | Must start in domain/repository layer.                    |

## Migration-required specs

The following business specs depend on pending schema changes. See
`docs/database/schema-contract.md` §Pending schema changes and §V1 migration gate.

- `docs/business/deck/deck-management.md` — `decks.target_language`
- `docs/business/study-actions/bury-suspend.md` — `flashcard_progress.buried_until`, `is_suspended`
- `docs/business/history/card-history.md` — Future Proposal; also requires
  `flashcard_progress.last_reset_at`, `study_attempts.box_before`, `box_after`
- `docs/business/srs/srs-review.md` — history persistence depends on
  `study_attempts.box_before/after`
- `docs/business/tts/tts-settings.md` — depends transitively on `decks.target_language`

Migration MUST run before implementing features that read/write these columns.

## Path convention

All backtick markdown references use **repo-root absolute paths, no leading slash**.

Correct:

```text
docs/business/folder/folder-management.md
```

Incorrect:

```text
/business/folder/folder-management.md
../business/folder/folder-management.md
```

## Cross-reference integrity

Intentional external references:

- `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` refer to project-root files, not files inside `docs/`.
- `lib/**`, `test/**`, `pubspec.yaml` references are repo-root paths.

All docs-internal `.md` references should resolve under `docs/**` unless explicitly marked as a
project-root file or future placeholder.
