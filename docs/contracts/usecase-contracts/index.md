# Use Case Contracts Index

> Target architecture note: `Either<Failure, T>` / `fpdart` references describe MemoX's intended
> error/result contract style. If the project has not yet adopted `fpdart`, do not add it during
> ordinary feature implementation. First run an approved dependency/API migration task, or use the
> existing repository error/result pattern until that migration is approved.

Use case = domain-layer orchestration unit. Each file in this folder enumerates use cases for one
entity / capability.

| File                                               | Covers                                                        |

## Conventions across all use case contracts

- **Signature:** `Future<Either<Failure, T>> call(...)` or `Stream<Either<Failure, T>> call(...)`
  for watch.
- **No throwing.** All errors via `Failure`.
- **Transactional integrity:** any state-mutating use case **notes** that it requires a single
  transaction. **Full transaction detail (which tables, which order) lives in the corresponding
  repository contract.** Use case docs MUST NOT duplicate the table list.
- **Idempotency:** noted where applicable. Default = NOT idempotent.
- **Caller responsibility:** confirmation dialogs are caller's responsibility (notifier triggers
  dialog before invoking use case for destructive actions).

## Ownership rule (source of truth)

| Concern                                                                 | Source of truth                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Business behavior, edge cases                                           | `docs/business/**`                 |
| UI states, copy, layout                                                 | `docs/wireframes/**`               |
| Use case signature, preconditions, rules, errors                        | This folder (`usecase-contracts/`) |
| Tables touched per mutation, exact transaction span, index dependencies | `repository-contracts/`            |
| Failure type definitions                                                | `docs/contracts/error-contract.md` |
| Enum / value object definitions                                         | `docs/contracts/types-catalog.md`  |
| Naming, file layout                                                     | `docs/contracts/code-style.md`     |

When repository contract and use case contract contradict on transaction detail, the **repository
contract wins**.

## Forbidden across all use cases

- ❌ Calling DAO directly (must go through repository).
- ❌ Calling other use cases without explicit composition (avoid hidden coupling).
- ❌ Use case taking `BuildContext` or any presentation-layer type.
- ❌ Use case returning Drift row type (must map to entity).
- ❌ Use case writing to logs directly without going through `core/logging`.
