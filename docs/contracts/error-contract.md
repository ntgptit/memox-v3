# Error Contract

> Target architecture note: `Either<Failure, T>` / `fpdart` references describe MemoX's intended
> error/result contract style. If the project has not yet adopted `fpdart`, do not add it during
> ordinary feature implementation. First run an approved dependency/API migration task, or use the
> existing repository error/result pattern until that migration is approved.

Single source of truth for: failure type taxonomy, error propagation rules, UI mapping, recovery
actions, and user-facing message conventions. Every layer of MemoX uses these failure types — no
ad-hoc exception subclasses.

## Principles

1. **Failures are values, not thrown exceptions.** Target architecture uses `Either<Failure, T>` (
   fpdart) for domain/data results. If the project has not adopted `fpdart` yet, use the existing
   repository error/result pattern and do not add the dependency in a normal feature task. Throwing
   is reserved for programmer errors (asserts, contract violations) and is never caught at
   application level.
2. **No raw exceptions in UI.** Presentation never sees `DriftWrappedException`, `SocketException`,
   `FormatException`. All low-level exceptions are mapped to a `Failure` at the data layer boundary.
3. **Failures are typed, not stringly.** Every recoverable error case has a named failure with
   structured fields, never `Failure(message: 'something went wrong')`.
4. **Keep user input on save failure.** A `Failure` from a save use case does NOT reset form state.
5. **Recovery is documented.** Each failure type below has a defined UI behavior; agents do not
   invent new recovery flows.

## Failure type hierarchy

All failures extend the sealed `Failure` base in `lib/core/error/failure.dart` (freezed sealed
class). The taxonomy is **closed**: adding a new top-level failure type requires updating this
contract AND every UI mapper.

### Sealed Failure (top-level)

| Failure type               | When raised                                                                       | UI mapping                                                               | Recovery                                                             |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ValidationFailure`        | Input violates business rule (empty name, tag with comma, length exceeded, etc.)  | Inline field error under offending input. Save button remains enabled.   | User edits input and retries.                                        |
| `NotFoundFailure`          | Entity referenced does not exist (folder/deck/flashcard/session)                  | Shared empty/error state with back action.                               | Pop or navigate to safe parent.                                      |
| `StorageFailure`           | Database read/write fails (transaction abort, disk error, constraint violation)   | Shared error widget OR snackbar (depending on if blocking).              | Offer Retry. Preserve user input.                                    |
| `NetworkFailure`           | Drive sync, OAuth, or any network IO fails                                        | Snackbar with retry. Non-blocking unless in restore flow.                | Retry button. Restore failures abort safely.                         |
| `AuthFailure`              | OAuth token invalid, refresh failed, account scope changed                        | Banner on Settings/Account: "Sign in expired. Tap to reconnect."         | User re-authenticates.                                               |
| `IntegrityFailure`         | Data invariant violated (cycle in folder tree, orphan reference, schema mismatch) | Blocking dialog, abort current operation.                                | Report to user, log severe. No automated recovery.                   |
| `ConflictFailure`          | Concurrent modification or duplicate detected during create/update                | Inline message with merge/replace options where applicable.              | User chooses resolution.                                             |
| `UnsupportedActionFailure` | Action invoked in invalid state (e.g., create deck inside subfolders-mode folder) | Action MUST be disabled in UI; if reached, surface as toast.             | UI should prevent reaching this. Programmer error if surfaced often. |
| `CancelledFailure`         | User cancelled mid-operation (rare; for long ops like import)                     | Silent; revert UI to pre-op state.                                       | No message needed.                                                   |
| `FinalizationFailure`      | Session completion partially failed (some attempts saved, summary couldn't write) | Banner on result screen with Retry. Session marked `failed_to_finalize`. | Retry finalization; data preserved.                                  |

### ValidationFailure subtypes

Validation is the most-used failure. Fields:

```
ValidationFailure(
  field: String,        // form field name, e.g., 'name', 'tag', 'front'
  code: ValidationCode, // enum
  message: String?,     // optional override; usually use code → l10n
)

enum ValidationCode {
  empty,
  tooLong,
  tooShort,
  invalidCharacter,   // e.g., comma in tag
  duplicate,
  invalidFormat,
  outOfRange,
  parentModeLocked,   // folder/deck mode mismatch
  cycleDetected,      // folder move would create cycle
  insufficientContent, // study match and guess require >= 5 cards
}
```

UI maps `(field, code)` to localized message. Mapping table lives in
`lib/core/error/validation_messages.dart` and l10n ARB keys follow pattern
`error_validation_{field}_{code}`.

### StorageFailure subtypes

```
StorageFailure(
  operation: StorageOp,  // read | write | transaction | migration
  table: String?,        // affected table name if known
  cause: String,         // technical detail for logs (NEVER shown to user)
)
```

`cause` is for `Logger.severe` only. UI shows generic message based on `operation`.

### NetworkFailure subtypes

```
NetworkFailure(
  kind: NetworkErrorKind, // offline | timeout | http(status) | parse
  retryable: bool,
)
```

`retryable=false` cases (auth required, manifest schema unsupported) hide retry button.

### IntegrityFailure

Reserved for **data corruption** — should never happen in normal operation. When raised:

1. Logger.severe with full stack.
2. Abort current operation.
3. Show user blocking dialog with "Contact support" CTA (file path: bug report).
4. Do NOT attempt automatic recovery.

## Error mapping by layer

### Data layer

- Wraps all `DriftWrappedException`, file IO, network calls in try-catch.
- Returns `Left(StorageFailure(...))` / `Left(NetworkFailure(...))` etc.
- NEVER lets a raw exception escape to domain.
- Exceptions to this rule: `AssertionError` (programmer bug), `OutOfMemoryError` (cannot recover)
  propagate up.

### Domain layer (use cases)

- Receives `Either<Failure, T>` from repository.
- Maps low-level failures to higher-level if helpful (e.g., `StorageFailure` on a single-row read
  might map to `NotFoundFailure` if not-found is a normal case for the use case).
- Adds `ValidationFailure` before calling repository.
- Returns `Either<Failure, T>` to caller.

### Presentation layer (notifier)

- Pattern-matches on `Failure` subtype.
- Updates `AsyncValue` state with the failure (or a wrapper type).
- NEVER throws.

### UI widget

- Reads `AsyncValue` or notifier state.
- Renders shared error widget (`MxErrorState`, `MxEmptyState`, `MxValidationField`, etc.) based on
  failure subtype.
- Never displays raw `Failure.toString()` or technical detail.

## User-facing message convention

| Quality               | Rule                                                                                      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tone                  | Calm, direct, never apologetic-spam ("Sorry, sorry, something went wrong!" is forbidden). |
| Length                | One sentence preferred. Two max.                                                          |
| Actionable            | Tell user what to do next, not just what failed.                                          |
| Specific when safe    | "Tag cannot contain a comma." > "Invalid input."                                          |
| Generic when not safe | "Couldn't save changes. Please try again." (do NOT expose SQLite error codes).            |
| No emoji              | Per Design System voice.                                                                  |
| Sentence case         | Per Design System voice.                                                                  |
| l10n only             | All messages live in ARB. No hardcoded strings in switch statements.                      |

### Standard copy bank

| Scenario                | Standard copy (en)                                                              |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Empty input             | "{Field} is required."                                                          |
| Too long                | "{Field} is too long (max {N} characters)."                                     |
| Tag has comma           | "Tags cannot contain commas."                                                   |
| Duplicate name          | "A {entity} with this name already exists in this {parent}."                    |
| Save failed (storage)   | "Couldn't save changes. Please try again."                                      |
| Read failed             | "Couldn't load. Tap to retry."                                                  |
| Entity not found        | "This {entity} no longer exists."                                               |
| Network offline         | "No connection. Check your network and try again."                              |
| Sync timeout            | "Sync took too long. Try again or check your connection."                       |
| Auth expired            | "Sign in expired. Tap to reconnect."                                            |
| Cycle in folder move    | "A folder cannot be moved inside itself or its subfolders."                     |
| Folder mode locked      | "This folder can only hold {subfolders                                          | decks}." |
| Match mode insufficient | "Match mode needs at least 5 cards. Try a different mode."                      |
| Concurrent modification | "Someone else changed this. Reloading."                                         |
| Finalization partial    | "Some session data couldn't be saved. Retry?"                                   |
| Restore snapshot failed | "Backup snapshot failed. Restore cancelled. Your data is unchanged."            |
| Generic catch-all       | "Something went wrong. Please try again." (use only when no specific case fits) |

l10n keys live in `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` under prefix `error_`. Per-field validation keys:
`error_validation_{field}_{code}`. Per-action keys: `error_action_{verb}`.

Current implementation note for folder lock-mode: MemoX's existing `Result<T>`/`AppFailure` path
uses validation failure codes `folder_contains_decks` and `folder_contains_subfolders` (constants in
`FailureCodes`) rather than the target `ValidationCode.parentModeLocked` enum. Folder Detail maps
these codes to `errorFolderContainsDecks` / `errorFolderContainsSubfolders` ARB keys so the user
sees typed localized copy instead of a generic error.

## Forbidden patterns

- ❌ Empty catch block (`catch (_) {}`). Must at minimum log.
- ❌ Catch-all `catch (e) { showSnackbar(e.toString()); }`.
- ❌ Throwing `Exception('...')` for business failure.
- ❌ Silent failure (no log, no UI signal).
- ❌ Stack trace in UI.
- ❌ Hardcoded user-facing error string in switch statement.
- ❌ Layer-jumping: presentation catching `DriftWrappedException`.
- ❌ Recovery action invented at call site (e.g., manual retry loop in widget). Use shared retry
  infrastructure.

## Required patterns

- ✅ `Either<Failure, T>` for all use case and repository signatures.
- ✅ `Failure` is sealed; pattern match exhaustively.
- ✅ `Logger.severe` for `IntegrityFailure`, `Logger.warning` for unexpected `StorageFailure`,
  `Logger.info` for recoverable `NetworkFailure`.
- ✅ Map at boundaries: data→domain maps raw exception, domain→presentation may refine failure type.
- ✅ Preserve user input on save failure. State is set back to dirty with failure attached.

## Test contract for errors

Every use case test MUST include:

- At least one happy-path test → `Right(T)`.
- At least one failure-path test per failure type the use case can return.
- Validation tests covering every `ValidationCode` the use case checks.
- Repository test for each `StorageFailure` cause (e.g., constraint violation, transaction abort).

See `docs/testing/test-strategy.md`.

## Agent rule

- When implementing a use case, FIRST add the failure types it can return to a comment on the
  signature, BEFORE writing the body.
- When adding a new failure type, update this contract in the same commit.
- When adding a new validation code, update `ValidationCode` enum AND the l10n key set AND this
  contract's standard copy bank.
- Do not introduce a new top-level failure subtype without explicit user approval.
