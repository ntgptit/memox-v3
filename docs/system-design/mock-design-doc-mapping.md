# Mock Design to Documentation Mapping

This document maps the MemoX mock design files to the Markdown documentation set.

It is intentionally created as a new bridge document. It does not replace the existing wireframes,
business specs, contracts, or design system documents.

## 1. Technical leadership decision

Yes, the mock design can and should be mapped to the documentation.

However, the mapping must be treated as a coordination layer, not as a new source of truth.

The correct priority is:

1. Business behavior source of truth: `docs/business/**`
2. Flow, route, and visual-structure source of truth: `docs/wireframes/**`
3. Per-screen mock-to-code visual contracts: `docs/design/**`
4. Architecture, state, use case, repository, and database contracts: `docs/architecture/**`,
   `docs/state/**`, `docs/contracts/**`, `docs/database/**`
5. Visual design source of truth: `docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/README.md` and
   `docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/colors_and_type.css`
6. Mock implementation reference: `docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/ui_kits/mobile/index.html`
7. Component preview reference: `docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/preview/*.html`
8. Uploaded screenshots: `docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/uploads/*`

The mock HTML must be used as a visual reference only. Do not copy inline styles, raw colors,
hardcoded spacing, JSX structure, or temporary demo data into Flutter production code.

## 3. Conflict resolution rule

When implementation agents find a conflict, resolve it in this order:

| Conflict type                              | Winner                                                                                | Reason                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Business rule conflict                     | `docs/business/**`                                                                    | Business docs define product behavior.                                  |
| Route/navigation conflict                  | `docs/business/navigation/navigation-flow.md` and matching wireframe                  | Routes must remain stable and testable.                                 |
| State/loading/error conflict               | Matching wireframe + `docs/state/state-management-contract.md`                        | Screen states must be driven by app state, not mock-only JSX flags.     |
| DB/schema conflict                         | `docs/database/**`                                                                    | Schema and migration contracts control what can be persisted.           |
| Use case/repository conflict               | `docs/contracts/**`                                                                   | Domain and data boundaries must not be bypassed.                        |
| Visual token conflict                      | `docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/colors_and_type.css` and Flutter theme tokens | Production UI must use tokens, not raw mock values.                     |
| Screen-level mock-element mapping conflict | `docs/design/screens/*.visual-contract.md` plus the matching wireframe                | Visual contracts refine mock elements without overriding product scope. |
| Layout shape conflict                      | Matching wireframe first, mock HTML second                                            | Wireframe is the structural contract; mock refines visual feel.         |
| Copy/text conflict                         | `docs/ui-ux/l10n-copy-contract.md`                                                    | UI text must be localizable and not copied blindly from mock.           |

## 4. Agent implementation rule

For any screen implementation task, the agent must read these in order:

1. This mapping document.
2. `docs/design/mock-design-index.md` and the matching `docs/design/screens/*.visual-contract.md`
   when present.
3. The matching wireframe from `docs/wireframes/**`.
4. The wireframe's `Implementation refs` section.
5. The linked business specs.
6. The linked use case and repository contracts.
7. `docs/state/state-management-contract.md`.
8. `docs/ui-ux/ui-ux-contract.md` and `docs/ui-ux/l10n-copy-contract.md`.
9. `docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/README.md`.
10. `docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/colors_and_type.css`.
11. The matching screen variant in
    `docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/ui_kits/mobile/index.html`.

The agent must not start from the HTML mock alone.

## 7. Legacy and stale mock references

The mobile mock file contains legacy component functions. The mobile README is now aligned with
the 129 rendered variants and labels them as Current / Partial / Future / Rejected / Visual-only
target.

| Legacy mock name   | Current production mapping                                         | Decision                                                                             |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `HomeScreen`       | `DashboardScreen` + `docs/wireframes/01-dashboard.md`              | Treat `HomeScreen` as old visual reference only. Use Dashboard naming in production. |
| `LibraryScreen`    | `LibraryOverviewScreen` + `docs/wireframes/02-library.md`          | Use current `Library overview` variants.                                             |
| `DeckScreen`       | `FolderDetailScreen` / `FlashcardListScreen` depending route       | Do not implement a generic DeckScreen unless docs explicitly require it.             |
| `CardsScreen`      | `FlashcardListScreen` + `docs/wireframes/06-flashcard-list.md`     | Use current flashcard list naming.                                                   |
| `CreateCardScreen` | `FlashcardCreateScreen` + `docs/wireframes/07-flashcard-create.md` | Use current flashcard create naming.                                                 |
| `BulkAddScreen`    | `DeckImportScreen` + `docs/wireframes/10-deck-import.md`           | Use deck import naming and bulk operation docs.                                      |
| `StatsScreen`      | `ProgressScreen` + `docs/wireframes/03-progress.md`                | Treat Stats as legacy. Production route is `/progress`.                              |

Technical decision: do not delete legacy functions from the mock without a separate design cleanup
task. For implementation, ignore them unless they are explicitly selected as visual references by
the technical lead.

## 9. Uploaded image mapping

The files in `docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/uploads/*` are source visual references.

Rules:

1. Do not implement directly from uploaded screenshots unless the matching wireframe and mock
   variant are identified.
2. If a screenshot conflicts with a wireframe, update the wireframe through a separate documentation
   task before coding.
3. Treat screenshots as visual evidence, not behavior contracts.
4. If a screenshot represents a new state not covered by `ui_kits/mobile/index.html`, add a new
   mapping row here before implementation.

## 10. Missing or weak mock coverage

| Area                         | Current issue                                                                             | Leadership decision                                                                                              |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Study entry gate             | No explicit rendered gallery group is mapped to `docs/wireframes/12-study-entry-gate.md`. | Implement from wireframe/business docs first. Add visual mock later if needed.                                   |
| Shared dialogs catalog       | Dialogs exist as embedded states, but not as a standalone complete gallery.               | Use `docs/wireframes/24-shared-dialogs.md` as source of truth. Mock embedded dialogs are visual references only. |
| Shared bottom sheets catalog | Sheets exist as embedded states, but not as a standalone complete gallery.                | Use `docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` as source of truth.                                             |
| Mobile kit README            | It now describes the 129-variant gallery and locks scope/status labels.                   | Keep it aligned whenever `index.html` screen names or state labels change.                                       |
| Legacy naming                | `Stats`, `Home`, `Deck`, `Cards`, `BulkAdd` appear in old mock code.                      | Use current docs naming: Dashboard, Progress, Folder detail, Flashcard list, Deck import.                        |
| Token drift                  | Some design docs may use old theme/color names.                                           | Resolve token conflicts in a separate design-system cleanup task before large-scale UI implementation.           |

## 11. Recommended implementation checklist per screen

For each screen or screen group:

1. Identify the mock variant IDs from this mapping.
2. Open `docs/design/mock-design-index.md` and the matching visual contract under
   `docs/design/screens/` when present.
3. Open the matching wireframe.
4. Read the wireframe `Implementation refs` section.
5. Read the linked business docs.
6. Read the linked contracts.
7. Inspect `colors_and_type.css` only to understand visual token intent.
8. Map mock visuals to existing Flutter theme/shared widgets.
9. Implement states in the notifier/view model, not with local mock flags.
10. Add or update tests using the decision table IDs where available.
11. Run recursive review against:
    - business docs,
    - wireframe,
    - visual contract,
    - mock visual state,
    - design system token rules,
    - architecture contracts.

## 12. Hard implementation bans

Do not do the following:

1. Do not copy raw CSS values from `index.html` into Flutter widgets.
2. Do not copy JSX component structure as Flutter architecture.
3. Do not create feature folders based only on legacy mock component names.
4. Do not introduce `stats` as a production feature if docs say `progress`.
5. Do not implement mock-only states that are not backed by business/state docs.
6. Do not bypass use cases/repositories just because mock data is local in HTML.
7. Do not put emoji strings into production UI. Emoji in visual drafts means icon intent only.
8. Do not use mock text as final UI copy without checking l10n contract.
9. Do not implement root-level decks from Library mock rows. Library root contains folders only;
   Folder Detail contains decks; every deck belongs to exactly one folder.
10. Do not implement nullable deck parent migration. That direction is Rejected / Not Applicable
    unless product ownership explicitly reverses the folder-owned deck invariant.

## 13. Final leadership position

This mapping makes the mock design usable by AI agents without letting the mock override the product
specification.

The correct workflow is:

```text
Markdown docs define behavior and architecture.
Design system defines visual rules and tokens.
Mock HTML shows the intended visual result.
Implementation maps all three into Flutter code through shared widgets and clean architecture boundaries.
```

With this mapping in place, future implementation prompts can safely say:

```text
Use docs/system-design/mock-design-doc-mapping.md to identify the correct mock variants and required Markdown specs before implementing any MemoX screen.
```
