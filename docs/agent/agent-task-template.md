# Agent Task Template

Template for giving a coding task to an AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.). Copy-paste, fill in, submit. Reduces variance across sessions.

---

## Read first (always)

- `CLAUDE.md` — top-level agent rules, especially Doc-code parity
- `AGENTS.md` — responsibilities, reporting
- `docs/business/index.md` — business spec map
- `docs/business/glossary.md` — domain terms

## Read for this task

- `docs/wireframes/{N-screen}.md` — UI contract for the screen
- `docs/business/{feature}/{spec}.md` — business behavior
- `docs/contracts/usecase-contracts/{entity}.md` — use case contracts
- `docs/contracts/repository-contracts/{entity}-repository.md` — data layer contract
- `docs/contracts/error-contract.md` — failure types
- `docs/contracts/types-catalog.md` — enums and value objects
- `docs/contracts/code-style.md` — naming, structure
- `docs/testing/test-strategy.md` — test layer mapping
- `docs/decision-tables/memox-core-decision-table.md` — rows: {LIST_RELEVANT_ROW_IDS}

(Add others as needed: state-management-contract.md, performance-contract.md, observability-contract.md, l10n-copy-contract.md.)

---

## Task

**Title:** {one-line task name}

**Type:** feature | fix | refactor | docs

**Description:**

{What needs to happen. Reference the business spec section and the decision rows. Keep this short — the docs above hold the detail.}

---

## Scope

**Allowed to change:**
- `lib/{specific paths}`
- `test/{specific paths}`
- `docs/{specific paths}` (per Doc-code parity — update if behavior changes)

**Not allowed to change:**
- {any out-of-scope files}
- Generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`)
- Schema (unless task is explicitly a migration)
- Top-level routes (unless task is explicitly routing)

---

## Expected behavior

- {bullet list of observable behaviors after this task is done, each ideally tied to a decision row or wireframe state}

---

## Out of scope / leave for later

- {explicit non-goals to prevent agent from scope-creeping}

---

## Verification

Run verification through the SINGLE entry (standalone `flutter analyze`/`test`,
`dart fix`/`format`, `build_runner`, guard do NOT write the commit marker, so the
pre-commit hook rejects the commit):

```bash
node tool/verify/run.mjs --test {targeted_test_paths}
```

For UI-from-mock tasks, regenerate goldens intentionally, then prove the gate is
real by re-running WITHOUT `--update`:

```bash
node tool/verify/run.mjs --update-goldens --test {golden_test_paths}
node tool/verify/run.mjs --test {targeted_test_paths}   # must pass without --update
```

For UI-touching tasks, also run a profile-mode build on Pixel 6 emulator and verify the perf budget from `docs/quality/performance-contract.md`.

---

## UI Density Gate (required for UI tasks)

Before finishing any task that adds or changes buttons, CTAs, or card actions,
report against `docs/ui-ux/action-hierarchy-contract.md`:

- [ ] **Compact mobile review** — checked at 360dp; no overflow, no hero block in cards.
- [ ] **Dominant primary count** — exactly one visually dominant primary action per screen (state the count).
- [ ] **Full-width buttons added** — list each, with the allowed context (bottom action / footer / empty state / onboarding / specified study submit) or a `// guard:full-width-action-reviewed <reason>` comment.
- [ ] **Large buttons added** — list each `MxButtonSize.large`, with the allowed context.
- [ ] **No card-level violation** — verified no card/list/dashboard widget uses `large` or `fullWidth` outside the allowed contexts.
- [ ] **Semantic preference** — used `MxActionButton` / `MxCardActions` rather than raw `MxPrimaryButton` / `MxSecondaryButton` where applicable.

If any box cannot be ticked, stop and explain why instead of shipping.

---

## Visual Parity Gate (required for UI-from-mock tasks)

`flutter analyze`, unit tests, and the guard are BLIND to spacing, padding, and
alignment — they will pass while the keycap hugs the border or a card's padding is
off by 8px. Before finishing a task that builds/changes a screen or shared widget
from a mock, tick:

- [ ] **Spec read** — read the `shots/` PNGs (light + dark, ALL states) and the
      measured DOM spec `.../specs/NN-*.md`; map from `rel`/`flex`/`gap`/`pad`/`mx:`,
      not absolute x/y.
- [ ] **Golden per state** — added/updated a `matchesGoldenFile` golden for each
      in-scope state (light + dark, 390×780); regenerated via
      `node tool/verify/run.mjs --update-goldens --test <paths>` and confirmed it
      passes WITHOUT `--update`. Never `--update` to silence an unexplained diff.
- [ ] **Tokens, not kit px** — used `Mx*` components + spacing/radius/typography
      tokens; did NOT chase sub-token kit px (e.g. an 11px icon when the smallest
      token is 16) — that is noise, not a bug.
- [ ] **Invariant in the shared widget** — if a layout detail belongs to a shared
      `Mx*` widget (trailing inset, alignment), fixed it THERE + added a geometry
      contract test, so every consumer is fixed at once.
- [ ] **Visual gaps listed** — each unmatched mock element marked Current / Future /
      Rejected / Missing-data / Token-missing / Mock-doc-conflict (do not silently
      drop, and do not fake Future data such as progress/mastery/new-card).

If any box cannot be ticked, stop and explain why instead of shipping.
See `docs/design/mock-to-ui-playbook.md` (Phase 7) for the full runbook.

## Output required

Reply with the report format from `docs/checklist/implementation-checklist.md` §Final report template. At minimum:

- **Summary** — 1-3 sentences
- **Changed code files** — paths
- **Changed doc files** — paths (or explicit "no docs needed because: …")
- **Doc-code parity check** — 8 ticks from `CLAUDE.md` §Pre-commit parity check
- **Drift detected during task** — any legacy mismatches found
- **Business impact** — what user sees that's different
- **Route impact** — routes added/changed
- **Persistence impact** — schema/storage changes
- **UI impact** — screens/widgets changed
- **Decision table/test impact** — row IDs touched, tests added
- **Verification result** — pass/fail per command above
- **Skipped checks or risks** — explicit, with reason

If the task cannot be completed safely without violating a hard rule, stop and report instead of working around it.

> **Expected behavior:**

## Anti-patterns to call out in task

If you suspect the agent may go off-rails, explicitly forbid in task:

- "Do not extend repository signature beyond methods listed in contract."
- "Do not introduce a new Failure subtype."
- "Do not add new top-level route."
- "Do not change SRS interval table."
- "Do not modify schema."
- "Do not log card content."
