# 01 — Dashboard

## Purpose

Dashboard top-level screen. Current V1 continues paused sessions and points to the next study action. Full motivation surfaces (computed streak, daily goal, reminders, streak history, and goal sheets) remain Target/Future.

## V1 release status

- Current V1: resume card (with Discard), **computed streak chip** (hidden at 0), **daily-goal
  ring** (hidden when goal disabled), Today's-review card (due count + deck-count + time estimate,
  routes to study only when due cards exist), **Start new learning** CTA with never-studied count,
  **Recent decks** section, app-bar **Global Search** shortcut, and the richer zero-content onboarding body.
- Streak and daily-goal read the source-backed `LoadDashboardProgressSummaryUseCase` (computed from
  `study_attempts` + persisted learning settings). They are no longer placeholders. The streak chip
  is hidden when the streak is 0; the goal ring is hidden when the goal is disabled, but the goal
  tile still stays visible in the disabled state.
- Recent decks and the never-studied "new" count read the source-backed
  `LoadDashboardDeckHighlightsUseCase` (`decks` ordered by `updated_at DESC`, with per-deck card
  count, due count, last-studied time).
- Offline, streak-broken, and paused-session count chrome are shown as current fidelity surfaces;
  the source-backed paused-session list sheet remains deferred.
- Target/Future: streak-history sheet, daily-goal slider/settings, reminders/notification
  permissions, and the deck/folder scope picker for "Start new learning" (V1 routes new learning
  straight to the global new-cards entry).
- Current app boot still redirects `/` to `RouteDefaults.initialLocation = RoutePaths.library`; changing launch default to Dashboard requires a dedicated navigation task.

Onboarding state replaces the entire body when `decks = 0 AND flashcards = 0`. Resume/streak/goal sections are hidden.

The Today card shows caught-up copy when `dueToday == 0`; it must not enter the study flow in that state.

## Inputs

| Param | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (none) | route | Dashboard is a top-level route with no params |

## Data to load

| Data | Source | Refresh trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Greeting (time-of-day) | local time via `clock.now()` | once per build |
| Resumable session (most recent + count) | `study_sessions` filtered by `status in (draft, in_progress)` AND `updated_at > now - 30d` | stream from DB |
| Current streak | `engagement_preferences` SharedPreferences | watch + foreground event |
| Daily goal target + today's progress | `engagement_preferences` + `study_attempts` today count | stream from DB + prefs |
| Today's due count across all decks | `flashcard_progress` filtered by `due_at <= now AND NOT suspended AND (buried_until IS NULL OR buried_until <= now)` | stream from DB |
| Recent decks (top 3 by updated_at) | `decks` ordered by `updated_at DESC` LIMIT 3 | stream from DB |
| Content count (for empty-state branch) | `COUNT(*) FROM decks` and `COUNT(*) FROM flashcards` | watch + invalidate on change |
| Goal-enabled / streak-enabled flags | SharedPreferences | watch |
| Streak-broken signal (one-time) | derived from `lastGoalMetDate` vs today | computed once per app foreground |

All queries fire in parallel via separate providers; UI shows skeletons per card, NOT blocking on slowest.

## Forbidden

- ❌ Call repositories or DAOs directly from `DashboardScreen` widget. Go through `DashboardNotifier`.
- ❌ Show "Streak: 0" label. Hide streak chip when streak is 0.
- ❌ Show goal ring when `goalEnabled == false`. Hide entirely.
- ❌ Change the current V1 launch default or promote Dashboard as the launch
  default without a dedicated navigation task.
- ❌ Cache resume card more than 30 seconds; it must refresh on session state changes.
- ❌ Refresh entire Dashboard on a single section change (e.g., goal update shouldn't trigger streak query).
- ❌ Compute due count inside widget build; use a provider.
- ❌ Block the screen on Drive sync state. Sync is settings-only.

## Components

| Component | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| Resume card | Visible iff at least one `study_sessions` row has `status IN (in_progress, draft)`. Shows most recent. "{n-1} more paused sessions" link when multiple. |
| Streak chip | Visible iff `currentStreak >= 1`. Tap → streak history bottom-sheet (`docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md`). |
| Goal progress ring | Visible iff `goalEnabled = true`. Ring color: theme primary when below goal, gold when met. Pulse animation on first goal-met of the day. |
| Today CTA | Primary filled button. Subtitle shows due count. Disabled state when zero due, with copy "All caught up — try studying new cards instead." |
| New learning CTA | Secondary outlined button. Tap → opens scope picker bottom-sheet (pick deck/folder/today). |
| Recent decks list | Last 3 opened decks ordered by `decks.updated_at` desc among rows touched by the user. |

## V1 implementation note (2026-06-14 full-mock build)

- **Resume card (with Discard), streak chip, daily-goal ring, Today's-review card, "Start new
  learning", and Recent decks** are implemented and tested
  (`test/presentation/features/dashboard/dashboard_screen_test.dart`).
- **Action density** follows `docs/ui-ux/action-hierarchy-contract.md`: the due/next-action card uses **compact, trailing-aligned, stacked** card actions (`MxActionButton` `cardPrimary`/`cardSecondary`) — not full-width hero CTAs, even though the mock draws full-width buttons. Exactly one dominant primary per card; the companion is a lighter secondary. The resume card uses `MxCardActions` (Continue primary / Discard secondary); Discard confirms via `showMxConfirmDialog` then `CancelStudySessionUseCase`.
- **Streak + daily goal** read `LoadDashboardProgressSummaryUseCase` via
  `dashboardProgressSummaryQueryProvider`. Streak chip hidden when streak `< 1`; goal ring hidden
  when the goal is disabled/unknown. Reminders, streak-history, daily-goal slider, and the
  streak-broken banner remain `Target`/Future.
- **Stats row density:** the two stat cards use a **compact tile** (`headlineMedium` value +
  overline caption + 32dp leading glyph/ring, 12dp padding), NOT the 48dp `MxStatDisplay` hero
  number — that hero size reads as too heavy on a phone, especially when only one stat is present
  and the card spans full width.
- **Today's review** reads `dashboardDueSummaryQueryProvider` (`ProgressDueSummary`): the title shows the total due count, the meta shows the number of decks with due cards and an estimated minutes figure (≈36s/card — copy only, not a scheduling input).
- **"Start new learning"** routes straight to the global new-cards study entry
  (`goStudyEntry(entryType: today, studyType: newCards)`) and shows the library-wide never-studied
  count. The two-step deck/folder **scope picker remains Future**; tag scope stays excluded.
- **Recent decks** read `LoadDashboardDeckHighlightsUseCase` via
  `dashboardDeckHighlightsQueryProvider` (top 3 decks by `updated_at`). Each row shows card count,
  last-studied relative time, and a due badge; tapping opens the deck flashcard list.
- **Onboarding (zero-content) layout** replaces the whole body when zero decks AND zero flashcards exist; it is not a dedicated route.
- **Global Search** is the top-level `/search` bottom-nav destination (design redesign); the
  Dashboard has no app-bar search shortcut (WBS 5.8.1 Rejected).

## States

| State | Trigger | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loading | Initial fetch on screen open | Show skeleton for each card section. Don't block on slowest query. |
| Populated | Normal | All sections render as shown. |
| Empty (onboarding) | `decks = 0 AND flashcards = 0` | Switch to onboarding layout. |
| Goal disabled | `goalEnabled = false` | Hide goal ring AND streak chip. Streak frozen, not advanced. |
| Resume only, no due | Has resumable but `todayDueCount = 0` | Resume card visible. "Today" CTA disabled with caught-up copy. |
| Streak broken (one-time on detect) | Last streak > 0 AND yesterday not goal-met | Show one-time banner above resume card: "Your N-day streak ended yesterday. Start a new one today!" Dismissed automatically after view. |
| Error (network/db) | Query failure | Show inline error card "Couldn't load Dashboard. [Retry]". |

## Actions

| Action | Trigger | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tap resume card "Continue" | Tap | Navigate to `/library/study/session/{sessionId}` (`pushReplacement` from Dashboard not needed — `push` is fine because Dashboard remains in nav stack). |
| Tap resume card "Discard" | Tap | Show "Discard paused session?" dialog (`docs/wireframes/24-shared-dialogs.md` §discard-session). On confirm: `study_sessions.status = cancelled`. |
| Tap "{n-1} more paused sessions" | Tap | Open bottom-sheet listing all resumable sessions (`docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` §paused-sessions). |
| Tap streak chip | Target/Future | Open streak history bottom-sheet only after full engagement is promoted. Current V1 static stat has no tap action. |
| Tap goal ring | Target/Future | Open daily-goal slider modal only after full engagement is promoted. Current V1 has no live goal ring. |
| Tap "Start today's review" | Tap | Navigate to `/library/study/today` → routes through study entry gate. |
| Tap "Start new learning" | Tap | Open scope picker bottom-sheet. |
| Tap recent deck row | Tap | Navigate to `/library/deck/:deckId/flashcards`. |
| ~~Tap search icon~~ | — | Removed (redesign): no Dashboard search icon; Search is the top-level `/search` tab (WBS 5.8.1 Rejected). |
| Tap settings icon | Tap | Navigate to `/settings`. |
| Pull to refresh | Pull down | Re-run all queries; replace skeletons in place. |

## Dialogs and bottom-sheets used

- Discard paused session dialog — see `docs/wireframes/24-shared-dialogs.md` §discard-session.
- Paused sessions list bottom-sheet — see `docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` §paused-sessions.
- Streak history bottom-sheet — Target/Future only; see `docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` §streak-history.
- Daily-goal slider — Target/Future only; see `docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` §daily-goal.
- Scope picker — see `docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` §scope-picker.

## Navigation in

- Bottom nav tap "Home".
- Deep link to `/home`.
- Target/Future launch default after a dedicated navigation task. Current V1 app
  boot still redirects `/` to Library.
- Deep link from notification when no resumable session exists.

## Navigation out

- Resume card "Continue" → study session.
- "Start today's review" → study entry gate.
- "Start new learning" → scope picker → study entry gate.
- Recent deck → flashcard list.
- Search icon → Target/Future Global Search only; no live V1 action.
- Settings icon → settings hub.

## Responsive

- ≥600dp: two-column layout. Resume/streak/goal in left column; Today/new/recent in right. Bottom nav becomes side rail.
- ≥1024dp: same as ≥600dp with wider gutters.

## Performance

- All queries fire in parallel on screen open.
- Skeleton per card; don't block on slowest.
- Resume card cached for 30s; invalidated by session state changes.
- Streak chip cached for 60s; invalidated on new attempt or app foreground.

## Accessibility

- All CTAs minimum 48dp tappable height.
- Goal ring announces `{progress} of {goal} cards`.
- Streak chip announces `{n}-day streak`.
- Onboarding state focus order: title → primary CTA → secondary CTA → sign-in.

## Rules

- Target/Future: Dashboard is the intended learning-first landing screen.
  Current V1 app boot still redirects `/` to Library; do not change that in a
  release-docs task.
- Resume card MUST appear above everything else when present.
- Onboarding state MUST replace ALL other Dashboard content when triggered.
- Goal ring MUST be hidden (not greyed) when goal disabled.
- Streak chip MUST be hidden when streak = 0 (avoid "Streak: 0" insult).

## Agent rule

- Do NOT add unrelated widgets here (e.g., weather, random tips).
- Do NOT show a "Streak: 0" label; hide entirely.
- Recent decks list is fixed at 3. Do not parameterize.
- Pull-to-refresh re-runs queries — do not silently no-op.
