# 05 — Folder Detail

## V1 verification status (2026-06-04, Prompts 45, 47, 47B, 50)

This screen is partially Current.

### Prompt 50 — decks-state visual/layout parity

- **Decks-mode hero card is Current** (`FolderHeroCard`,
  `lib/presentation/features/folders/widgets/folder_hero_card.dart`). It folds
  the previous deck-mode stat strip and the Study/Today card into one soft
  gradient hero card (`MxCard.heroGradient`: a subtle primary→secondary wash,
  quiet primary-tinted border, light shadow — not a saturated accent fill)
  matching the mock decks state: a hero mastery ring
  (`MxProgressRing(size: hero)`), a `Folder mastery` overline, a
  `{deckCount} decks · {cardCount} cards` line, a `{dueCount} due` /
  `All caught up` sub-line, and the folder-scoped Start study CTA.
  - **Mastery ring is Current**: it is data-backed — the percent is the average
    of the folder's deck mastery (`FolderDeckItem.masteryPercent`); no
    placeholder value.
  - **`{n} new` stays Future**: there is no read model for a folder "new" count,
    so it is never rendered (no hardcoded value).
  - **Start study CTA preserves the Study Entry Gate contract**: with due > 0 it
    routes `entry_type=folder` + `study_type=srs_review` (key
    `folder_study_today_action`) and offers a secondary `Study folder`
    (`folder_study_folder_action`, no `study_type`); with due == 0 and cards > 0
    it routes `entry_type=folder` with no `study_type`. The card never starts a
    session directly.
  - **Resume banner is unchanged** and still rides above the hero when a paused
    folder session exists (Resume opens it; Discard cancels via the shared
    confirmation flow).
- **Section-header overline is Current** (`FolderSectionTitle`): a compact
  `{n} DECKS` / `{n} SUBFOLDERS` overline above the search/sort toolbar for a
  locked folder with children. Search/sort still use the shared
  `MxSearchSortToolbar<ContentSortMode>` (scope-local, no behavior change).
- Subfolders / unlocked / search-empty / loading / error / delete / move-sheet
  states keep their existing Current behavior and shared components; this prompt
  was visual/layout parity only (no schema, SRS, repository, or use-case change).
- Still Future/out of scope (unchanged): Global Search, `/library/search`,
  Flashcard History, tag-scoped study, root-level decks, Onboarding,
  engagement/streak/daily-goal/reminders, bulk suspend/reset/tag. The decks-mode
  FAB stays `New deck` (not the mock's `New card`): creating a card needs a
  specific `deckId` and decks mode has many decks, so auto-picking is unsafe and
  not an approved flow.

Current V1:

- `/library/folder/:id` opens Folder Detail.
- Invalid/missing `folderId` shows a safe error surface with Retry.
- Breadcrumb/back navigation is Current.
- Subfolder-mode renders subfolders only.
- Deck-mode renders decks only.
- Unlocked mode renders true empty choice flow.
- Inline scope-local search is Current.
- True-empty vs search no-results is Current:
  - true empty = no unfiltered direct children
  - no-results = active search hides existing children
- Sort UI via `MxSearchSortToolbar<ContentSortMode>` is Current.
- Create subfolder/deck by content mode is Current.
- Typed lock-mode snackbar is Current from Prompt 14.
- Row actions currently exposed: folder/deck actions sheet, move/delete/import/duplicate/export according to owner.
- **Study-entry banners are Current from Prompt 45** (`FolderStudyEntrySection`,
  `lib/presentation/features/folders/widgets/folder_study_entry_section.dart`),
  shown above the children list when the recursive folder scope has cards or a
  resumable session:
  - **Resume banner** — visible iff a resumable session with `entry_type=folder,
    entry_ref_id=this.id` exists; Resume opens that session directly
    (`context.goStudySession`), never creating a new one. Discard is Current
    from Prompt 47: it shows a danger confirmation (`MxConfirmationDialog`);
    confirm cancels the existing paused session via the shared Resume-Discard
    flow (`confirmAndDiscardResumeSession` → `CancelStudySessionUseCase`
    through `progressSessionActionControllerProvider`, which bumps the
    study-session revision so the banner refreshes away); Cancel/barrier
    dismissal does nothing. Discard never creates a session.
  - **Today CTA** — visible iff recursive `dueCount > 0`; routes to the Study
    Entry Gate with `entry_type=folder` + `study_type=srs_review` (folder-scoped due
    review). Hidden at zero.
  - **Study folder CTA** — visible iff recursive `totalCardCount > 0`; routes to
    the Study Entry Gate with `entry_type=folder` (new study).
  - The section never starts a session itself; the Study Entry Gate owns
    empty-scope validation, resume conflict, and session creation.
  - Recursive counts + resumable session come from
    `GetFolderStudyEntryUseCase` (reuses `StudyRepo.countFlashcardsInScope` /
    `countDueCardsInScope` / `findResumeCandidate`); no schema added.

Future / not exposed in V1:

- "{n} new" subtitle from the mock decks-mode hero card (no read model).
- Global Search route.
- Flashcard History.
- tag-scoped study.

The mastery ring + decks-mode hero card and the Study/Today CTAs are now Current
(see "Prompt 50" above). The remaining mock detail ("{n} new") stays Future and
must not be rendered with a placeholder value by ordinary parity work.

## Purpose

Browse a folder's children: either subfolders or decks, never both. V1 focuses on folder/deck browsing, inline search/sort, create actions, and row actions. Folder-level study CTAs (Study folder / Today) and the Resume banner are Current from Prompt 45 and route through the Study Entry Gate.

## Inputs

| Param | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `folderId` (required path param) | URL | resolves to a `folders.id`; 404 if invalid |

## Data to load

| Data | Source | Refresh trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Folder detail (name, content_mode, parent chain for breadcrumb) | `folders` lookup + recursive parent join | watch |
| Breadcrumb path | derived from parent chain | follows folder detail |
| Child folders (when mode=subfolders) | `folders WHERE parent_id = :folderId ORDER BY sort_order` | stream |
| Child decks (when mode=decks) | `decks WHERE folder_id = :folderId ORDER BY sort_order` | stream |
| Recursive card count (for Study folder CTA) | **Current (Prompt 45).** `GetFolderStudyEntryUseCase` → `StudyRepo.countFlashcardsInScope` over the folder subtree | re-resolves on content/session revision + folder re-entry |
| Recursive due count (for Today CTA) | **Current (Prompt 45).** `StudyRepo.countDueCardsInScope` over the folder subtree | re-resolves on content/session revision + folder re-entry |
| Resumable session for this scope | **Current (Prompt 45).** `StudyRepo.findResumeCandidate` matched on `entry_type=folder` and `entry_ref_id=:folderId` | re-resolves on session revision + folder re-entry |

## Forbidden

- ❌ Show both "New subfolder" and "New deck" in FAB for a locked folder.
- ❌ Allow tapping past mode-lock without explicit user choice in unlocked mode.
- ❌ Display "Today (0)" — hide the Today CTA when 0 due (Current rule, Prompt 45).
- ❌ Truncate breadcrumb so user loses location. Past 3 levels, use middle ellipsis but keep first and last.
- ❌ Auto-unlock a locked-but-empty folder. Wait for explicit user action.
- ❌ Start a session directly from Folder Detail — Study/Today/Resume must go through the Study Entry Gate (or resume the existing session); the gate owns empty-scope validation and session creation.

## Components

| Component | Spec |
| --- | --- |
| App bar back | Returns to parent folder or Library. |
| Breadcrumb | Full path from Library to current. Tap any segment to jump. |
| Resume banner | **Current (Prompt 45; Discard added Prompt 47).** Visible iff resumable session with `entry_type=folder, entry_ref_id=this.id`. Resume (primary) opens that session (`context.goStudySession`); no new session created. Discard (secondary, destructive) cancels the paused session after confirmation (shared `confirmAndDiscardResumeSession`); never creates a session. |
| Study folder CTA | **Current (Prompt 45).** Tap → study entry gate `study/folder/:folderId` (new study). Shown iff recursive `totalCardCount > 0`. |
| Today CTA | **Current (Prompt 45).** Tap → study entry gate `study/folder/:folderId?study_type=srs_review` (folder-scoped review of due cards). Shown iff recursive `dueCount > 0` (hidden at zero). Note: this is `entry_type=folder` filtered to due via `study_type=srs_review`, NOT `entry_type=today` (which is global). |
| Subfolder row (subfolders mode) | Icon + name + "{n} subfolders" or "{n} decks" subtitle + chevron. |
| Deck row (decks mode) | Icon + name + "{n} cards" + optional "{m} due" badge + chevron. |
| FAB | **Current.** Plus button. Action depends on mode: New subfolder (subfolders mode), New deck (decks mode), choice both (unlocked mode). |
| Empty state | When `unlocked` and zero children: show choice layout. |
| Search + sort toolbar | **Current.** Renders via shared `MxSearchSortToolbar<ContentSortMode>` (`lib/presentation/shared/widgets/mx_search_sort_toolbar.dart`). Combines inline search field + sort menu chip into a single sticky row above the children list. Same widget instance is also used by other browsing surfaces; do NOT fork it. Sort options come from `ContentSortMode` enum (`lib/domain/enums/content_sort_mode.dart`). |

## States

| State | Trigger | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loading | Initial fetch | Skeleton rows. |
| Populated | Has children | List shown. |
| Empty (unlocked) | Zero children | Empty state with mode-choice buttons. |
| Empty (locked) | Locked but empty (shouldn't happen normally; can occur if all children deleted) | Show "This folder is empty" with FAB action only. Don't auto-unlock. |
| Resume present | **Current (Prompt 45).** Folder has resumable session | Show Resume banner above CTAs. |
| Folder not found | `:id` invalid or deleted | Show error "Folder not found" with back button. |

## Actions

| Action | Trigger | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tap back | Back | Pop to parent. |
| Tap breadcrumb segment | Tap | Go to that segment's folder; deep stack if needed. |
| Tap subfolder row | Tap | **Current.** `push` to `/library/folder/:childId`. |
| Tap deck row | Tap | **Current.** `push` to `/library/deck/:deckId/flashcards`. |
| Long-press row | Long-press | Open item context sheet (Rename / Move / Delete). |
| Tap "Study folder" | Tap | **Current (Prompt 45).** Navigate to `study/folder/:folderId` → study entry gate (new study). |
| Tap "Today (n)" | Tap | **Current (Prompt 45).** Navigate to `study/folder/:folderId?study_type=srs_review` → study entry gate (folder-scoped review). |
| Tap resume banner Resume | Tap | **Current (Prompt 45).** Navigate to the existing `study/session/{sessionId}`. No new session created. |
| Tap resume banner Discard | Tap | **Current (Prompt 47).** Show danger discard confirmation; on confirm cancel the paused session (shared `confirmAndDiscardResumeSession` → `CancelStudySessionUseCase`), refresh banner away. Cancel does nothing. Never creates a session. |
| Tap FAB | Tap | **Current.** Action depends on `content_mode`: open New folder dialog OR New deck sheet OR a 2-button picker (unlocked). |
| Tap overflow ⋮ | Tap | Menu: Rename folder / Move folder / Delete folder / Sort by. |

## Dialogs and bottom-sheets used

- Resume banner discard dialog — **Current (Prompt 47).** `MxConfirmationDialog` (danger) composed via the shared discard flow: `docs/wireframes/24-shared-dialogs.md` §discard-session.
- New folder dialog — `docs/wireframes/24-shared-dialogs.md` §folder-create.
- New deck bottom-sheet — `docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` §deck-create.
- Folder rename dialog — `docs/wireframes/24-shared-dialogs.md` §rename.
- Move-to-folder picker — `docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` §folder-picker.
- Delete folder dialog — `docs/wireframes/24-shared-dialogs.md` §delete-confirm.
- Item context sheet — `docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` §item-context.

## Navigation in

- Tap folder row from Library.
- Breadcrumb tap from descendant.
- Search result tap.

## Navigation out

- Subfolder row → child folder detail.
- Deck row → flashcard list.
- Study CTAs → **Future in V1.** Target: study entry gate / session.
- Back/breadcrumb → ancestor.

## Responsive

- ≥600dp: 2-col grid for rows. CTAs become inline buttons above grid.

## Performance

- Stream-based query for children based on `folder_id = :id`.
- Target/Future: recursive card count for folder-level study CTA cached for 30s; recalculated after content changes.

## Accessibility

- Breadcrumb is a single accessibility region; segments are buttons.
- Target/Future: "Study folder" disabled state announces reason ("No cards in this folder").

## Rules

- Folder shows EITHER subfolders OR decks based on `content_mode`. Never mixed.
- FAB action constrained by `content_mode`.
- Creating the first child in `unlocked` mode locks the folder to the corresponding mode.
- If a stale UI path or concurrent update attempts the incompatible action, the operation is rejected and the screen shows a localized snackbar, not a generic error:
  - folder already containing decks + create-subfolder attempt → "This folder already contains decks. Create a deck here or choose another folder for subfolders."
  - folder already containing subfolders + create-deck attempt → "This folder already contains subfolders. Create a subfolder here or choose another folder for decks."
- Deleting the last child can unlock back to `unlocked` (per `docs/business/folder/folder-management.md` state diagram).
- Empty folder in `unlocked` mode MUST show mode-choice empty state (not generic empty).
- Resume banner MUST appear above all other CTAs when present (Current, Prompt 45).

## Agent rule

- Do NOT show both "New subfolder" and "New deck" in a locked folder's FAB.
- Do NOT navigate user past mode-lock without explicit choice in unlocked mode.
- Breadcrumb MUST not become so long it overlaps title; truncate middle segments with ellipsis past ~3 levels.
- "Today (n)" CTA hidden when n = 0 (don't show "Today (0)") (Current, Prompt 45).
- Folder Detail MUST NOT bypass the Study Entry Gate; Today/Study folder route to the gate and Resume opens the existing session.
