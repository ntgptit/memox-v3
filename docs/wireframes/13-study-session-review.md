# 13 — Study Session: Review Mode

> **Drift correction (2026-06-10):** this mode is **Specified — NOT built** (WBS 4.5.2/4.5.3) in the current codebase. V1 implements
> only the recall self-grade flow through the shared shell
> `lib/presentation/features/study/screens/study_session_screen.dart`; other modes resolve to a
> controlled-unsupported strategy (`study_mode_strategy_factory.dart`). Any
> `lib/presentation/features/study/widgets/study_session/**` file paths referenced below are the
> **target structure** from a previous iteration and do NOT exist — verify against
> `lib/presentation/features/study/widgets/` before relying on them. Work is tracked as WBS 4.5.x
> in `docs/project-management/wbs.md`.

## Purpose

Front + back shown together on a single card. User reads, self-evaluates whether they knew it, then
advances by swipe. Lightest mode in the 5-mode cycle; serves as the **anchor screen** that
establishes the visual grammar reused by modes 14-17 (top app bar, progress bar, mode pill
convention).

> **Current V1 implementation note.** The shipped screen at
> `/library/study/session/:sessionId` is a minimal persisted self-grade shell:
> it loads the session header + ordered session items, shows the current card
> with a reveal toggle, exposes Forgot / Got it grading after reveal, marks the
> answered session item in-session, resets reveal state when moving between
> cards, offers a safe exit action, and shows a Finish Session CTA only after
> every card has been answered. The result route stays a placeholder and
> `flashcard_progress` is not updated until Finish Session succeeds.

> **Mode pill / progress-bar color convention (applies to wireframes 13-17).** Modes split into two
> visual families:
>
> - **Blue family** (recognition modes): Review, Match, Guess. Progress bar fills with the primary
    blue token. Mode pill (when shown) uses blue.
> - **Green family** (production modes): Recall, Fill. Progress bar fills with the secondary green
    token. Mode pill uses green.
>
> This visual cue tells the user at a glance whether the current mode tests recognition (passive) or
> production (active). Review mode does NOT show a mode pill in the top bar (it is the default mode
> and uses the bare progress bar); modes 14-17 do show the pill.

## Layout — single state (front + back both visible)

Both sides render together — there is no "Show answer" tap step in this mode. The user advances by
swiping (gesture is the primary input).

## Forbidden

- ❌ Add a "Show answer" intermediate step. Review mode shows both sides at once.
- ❌ Hide the `example` field when present. Render it as a pill below the back.
- ❌ Show `note`, `pronunciation`, or `hint` inline (Phase 1; only `example` surfaces here).
- ❌ Use the green progress-bar color in this mode. Review is in the blue family.
- ❌ 4-button "Hard / Easy" grading.
- ❌ Auto-play `back` via TTS. Front-only policy.
- ❌ TTS auto-play when `deck.target_language = unsupported`.
- ❌ Persist grade BEFORE loading next card visually. Order: gesture → persist (background) → next
  card UI.
- ❌ Allow exit without confirmation when answered > 0.
- ❌ Make swipe optional. In this mode swipe is the **primary** input; tap fallback exists but is
  secondary.
- ❌ Add a TTS icon inline on the card. TTS surfaces via card-actions sheet only (long-press).
- ❌ Update SRS box outside `GradeAttemptUseCase`.

| Example pill      | Optional. Rounded surface around `flashcards.example`. Only renders when example is non-empty. Center-aligned.                                                                                                 |
| Swipe hint footer | Caption-sized, with a `»` chevron prefix. Copy: "Swipe left for the next card". Fades out after the user has swiped 3 times in this session (already learned).                                                 |

| Card visible               | Card opened                                | Front + back both rendered. Swipe hint shown for first 3 cards of the session, then hidden. |
| Swiping                    | Drag begins                                | Card follows finger; releasing past the threshold commits a grade.                          |
| Grading                    | Swipe committed (or tap on grade fallback) | Persist attempt + SRS update; advance to next card with horizontal slide.                   |
| Buried via long-press menu | Long-press the card                        | Bottom-sheet with Bury / Suspend / History / Audio settings. Bury → toast 5s undo; advance. |

|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Swipe right     | Drag right past threshold | `result = perfect`; persist; next card.                                     |
| Swipe left      | Drag left past threshold  | `result = forgot`; persist; next card.                                      |
| Tap card        | Tap (fallback)            | Open inline Forgot / Perfect prompt (accessibility / motor fallback).       |
| Long-press card | Long-press                | Open card actions bottom-sheet (Bury / Suspend / History / Audio settings). |
| Tap ✕           | Tap                       | Show exit confirm dialog.                                                   |

## Current V1 controls

- Previous button is disabled on the first card.
- Next button is disabled on the last card.
- Moving Previous/Next resets the answer to hidden before the next card is shown.
- Reveal shows Forgot / Got it actions for the current unanswered card.
- Grading marks the current session item answered and advances to the next unanswered item when available.
- When all cards in the session are answered, show the ready-to-finish message, keep browsing available, and show the Finish Session CTA.
- The swipe-based grading table below is the future review-mode target and does not describe the shipped V1 interaction.

## Dialogs and bottom-sheets used

- Exit session confirm — `docs/wireframes/24-shared-dialogs.md` §exit-session.
- Card actions sheet — `docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` §card-actions.
- Bury/suspend undo toast — `docs/wireframes/25-shared-bottom-sheets.md` §undo-toast.

## SRS handling on answer

Current V1 self-grade uses Forgot / Got it after reveal and records the attempt in-session. The swipe rows below remain the forward target for the full review-mode design.

Per `docs/business/srs/srs-review.md`:

- result=`perfect` (swipe right): `box_before = current`, `box_after = min(current+1, 8)`.
- result=`forgot` (swipe left): `box_before = current`, `box_after = 1`. `lapse_count++`.

Insert `study_attempts` row with `box_before`, `box_after`, `result`, `study_mode = 'review'`,
`attempted_at = now`. See `docs/contracts/usecase-contracts/study.md` §GradeAttemptUseCase.

## TTS behavior (per `docs/business/tts/tts-settings.md`)

Review mode has **no inline TTS button** in the design. TTS is reachable via the card-actions
bottom-sheet (long-press → "Speak front"). Rationale: review mode is a fast-flowing self-grade; a
TTS button on the card would compete with the swipe gesture target. Modes 14-17 surface a TTS icon
inside the card because their gestures are taps, not swipes.

When `autoPlay = true` AND `deck.target_language` is supported, the engine still auto-plays `front`
on card open (silent UI).

## Navigation in

- Auto-redirect from study entry gate.
- Resume from Dashboard / banner.
- Deep link from notification.

## Navigation out

- Last card answered → study result (`pushReplacement`).
- Exit confirmed → pop to caller when possible, otherwise go Library through the route helper.
- History action (from sheet) → flashcard history (push, returnable).
- Audio settings (from sheet) → audio-speech settings (push, returnable).

## Responsive

- ≥600dp: card centered with max-width ~520dp; vertical spacing increased between front and back
  regions.
- ≥1024dp: card stays centered; surrounding viewport color matches scaffold background, no extra
  chrome.
- Landscape: card occupies viewport vertically; swipe gesture unchanged.

## Performance

- Pre-fetch next card on swipe-commit (parallel with persistence).
- Swipe animation runs at 60fps; physics-based simulation, not linear interpolation.
- TTS init at session start; reuse engine across cards.

## Accessibility

- Card announces front and back in sequence on focus.
- Swipe gestures have a tap fallback (tap → inline Forgot/Perfect buttons).
- Reduced-motion users see a cross-fade instead of the horizontal slide on card advance.
- Swipe hint footer carries `Semantics(hint: 'Swipe right for Perfect, swipe left for Forgot')`.

## Rules

- Card MUST render both sides at once. No reveal step.
- Swipe MUST be the primary input. Tap fallback is for accessibility only.
- TTS button is NOT inline in review mode. Surfaces via card-actions sheet.
- Exit confirmation MUST appear before pop.
- `box_before` and `box_after` MUST be recorded on every attempt.
- `example` field MUST render as a pill below the back when non-empty. `note`, `pronunciation`,
  `hint` are NOT shown in this mode (Phase 1).

## Agent rule

- Do NOT introduce a "Show answer" CTA in this mode. Both sides are visible from the start.
- Do NOT add a TTS icon to the card body. TTS lives in the actions sheet.
- Swipe gestures are MANDATORY (not optional). Tap is fallback only.
- Render `example` as a pill below the back. Do not render `note` / `pronunciation` / `hint` here —
  those surface in card detail, not study session.
- Use blue progress-bar color token. Mismatching family color = bug.

## Implementation refs

**Business specs:**

- `docs/business/study/study-flow.md` (review mode)
- `docs/business/srs/srs-review.md` (perfect / forgot transitions)
- `docs/business/study-actions/bury-suspend.md` (overflow actions via sheet)
- `docs/business/tts/tts-settings.md` (front-only playback)

**Decision rows:**

- S section (review mode), SRS section (perfect/forgot transitions)

**Schema / storage:**

- INSERT `study_attempts` (box_before, box_after, result, study_mode='review', attempted_at)
- UPDATE `flashcard_progress` (current_box, due_at, review_count, lapse_count, last_studied_at)

**Contracts:** `docs/contracts/usecase-contracts/study.md` §GradeAttemptUseCase,
`docs/contracts/usecase-contracts/srs.md`, `docs/contracts/usecase-contracts/tts.md`

**Code paths (verified 2026-05-28):**

- Shared shell: `lib/presentation/features/study/screens/study_session_screen.dart` (app bar,
  progress bar, exit handling).
- Mode view:
  `lib/presentation/features/study/widgets/study_session/review/review_mode_session_view.dart` +
  `review_mode_card.dart` + `review_mode_panel.dart`.
- Swipe gesture:
  `lib/presentation/features/study/widgets/study_session/review/review_page_scroll_behavior.dart` (
  no standalone `swipe_to_grade.dart`; behavior is embedded in the page scroll behaviour widget).
- Grading: `lib/domain/study/usecases/study_usecases.dart` → `RecordStudySessionAnswerUseCase`
  (the only in-session answer path today; the `AnswerFlashcardUseCase` / `Answer*BatchUseCase`
  family from a previous iteration does NOT exist). No standalone `grade_attempt_usecase.dart`
  exists either.
- SRS transitions: no standalone `lib/domain/srs/box_transition.dart` exists. Runtime finalization
  lives in `lib/data/repositories/study_repo_impl.dart`; in-session study use cases record attempts
  and re-queue failed cards.
- TTS: see `lib/presentation/features/study/widgets/study_session/study_speak_button.dart` for the
  in-mode button; engine lives behind `lib/presentation/features/tts/providers/`.
