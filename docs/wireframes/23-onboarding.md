# 23 — Onboarding / Zero-Content Guidance

## V1 decision

V1 does **not** implement a dedicated onboarding feature folder, first-launch welcome screen, or
onboarding route.

V1 onboarding means: **strong empty states when the app has zero content**, with clear CTAs to
create, import, or restore data.

## Prompt 26 V1 honesty sweep — 2026-06-01

- Full onboarding is still **Future Proposal**: no `/onboarding` route, no onboarding feature
  under `lib/presentation/features/`, no first-launch preference gate, and no multi-step
  wizard.
- Current V1 uses existing owner surfaces only. Library true-empty owns its local Create folder CTA;
  Folder Detail owns mode-appropriate New subfolder / New deck CTAs; Flashcard List owns Add
  flashcard and deck Import entry points; Account Settings owns sign-in, manual Drive upload, and
  manual Drive restore.
- Restore guidance must navigate or point to Account Settings. It must not imply a standalone
  onboarding restore wizard, auto-restore after sign-in, or the full restore-protection target as
  Current.
- Dashboard zero-content onboarding remains Target/Future unless a dedicated Dashboard task
  implements code, tests, and docs.

## V1 purpose

A new or freshly restored user should immediately understand the next useful action:

1. Create the first deck.
2. Import cards from CSV/Excel.
3. Restore from Google Drive backup.

## V1 entry conditions

| Condition                                    | Surface                                        | Behavior                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `decks.count == 0 AND flashcards.count == 0` | Library empty state                            | Show zero-content guidance and CTAs.                                                     |
| `decks.count == 0 AND flashcards.count == 0` | Dashboard empty state, if Dashboard is visible | Show zero-content guidance and CTAs.                                                     |
| User is signed out                           | Empty state                                    | Restore CTA first leads to sign-in, then user can restore manually/through account flow. |
| User is signed in                            | Empty state                                    | Restore CTA opens restore flow or Settings/Account restore entry.                        |

V1 should preserve current route behavior unless a separate navigation task changes it.

## V1 CTA behavior

| CTA                       | Behavior                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create first deck         | Opens existing deck-create dialog/bottom sheet.                                                                                   |
| Import CSV / Excel        | If no deck exists, first create/select destination deck using existing deck creation flow, then open import.                      |
| Restore from Google Drive | If signed out, start Google sign-in or navigate to Settings/Account. If signed in, open restore entry point. Do not auto-restore. |

## V1 states

| State              | Trigger                               | Behavior                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero content       | No deck and no flashcard              | Show create/import/restore CTAs.                         |
| Create in progress | Create deck action active             | Use existing dialog state/loading/error behavior.        |
| Import handoff     | Import selected with no deck          | Require destination deck before import.                  |
| Restore handoff    | Restore selected                      | Go through account/restore flow; no automatic overwrite. |
| Non-empty content  | At least one deck or flashcard exists | Hide zero-content onboarding copy.                       |

## V1 forbidden behavior

- Do not create an onboarding feature under `lib/presentation/features/`.
- Do not add an onboarding route.
- Do not add a multi-step tutorial carousel.
- Do not add a first-launch welcome screen in V1.
- Do not block app usage behind sign-in.
- Do not auto-trigger restore after sign-in.
- Do not overwrite local data without the existing restore safety flow.

## Future Proposal — full onboarding flow

The full onboarding flow may be promoted later if product wants a stronger first-run experience.

Future scope may include:

- A one-time welcome screen controlled by `firstLaunchCompletedAt`.
- A richer create/import/restore handoff.
- A lightweight restore prompt when Drive backup is detected and local DB is empty.
- Dedicated onboarding state/notifier.
- Mock variants `28a`–`28i` from the design kit.

Future promotion requires updating:

- `docs/business/system/overview.md` (capability table) + the Deferred / Future / Rejected
  register in `docs/project-management/wbs.md` (§6)
- State/use case contracts for onboarding.

## Agent rule

During V1, implement only zero-content empty-state improvements and restore CTA routing. Do not
create a standalone onboarding feature or route.
