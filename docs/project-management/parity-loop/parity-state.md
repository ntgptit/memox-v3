# Parity Loop — State (pointer / HINT only)

Loop goal: bring each FE-built screen to pixel parity with the UI kit
(`docs/system-design/MemoX Design System/ui_kits/mobile/`), one smallest work-package
per loop. Visual-only; behavior is docs-owned.

## Active screen

- **12 — Study · Review** (study feature) — NEXT screen (run audit / BƯỚC 2). Confirm FE exists
  (`lib/presentation/features/study/**` — study mode files exist), then audit. Study/SRS screen → add
  `srs-reviewer` to fan-out. 13 Match (3 states), 14 Guess, 15 Recall, 16 Fill, 17 Result follow.

### Screen 07/08 — Flashcard editor: DONE (modulo deferred)

All states covered (07 empty/valid/details-open/saving/save-failed + 08 loaded/loading/load-error/
saving/save-failed + delete via shared confirm). create-valid golden added. validation = behavior-owned
(disable-Save, no inline errors). Deferred: field-fill (app-wide), DECK selector (Future), Note→3 fields
(business). dark≈2× = general Ahem amplification. See `screen-plans/07-08-flashcard-editor.md`.

- **07/08 — Flashcard editor** — AUDIT done (see
  `docs/project-management/parity-loop/screen-plans/07-08-flashcard-editor.md`). One shared
  `FlashcardEditorForm`; 7 goldens cover most states. KEY finding: **dark ≈2× light** across editor
  states. INVESTIGATED: dark≈2× is general Ahem-on-dark amplification (all screens), NOT editor-specific;
  the real gap is `MxTextField` fill = surfaceMuted vs kit accent-contrast (=surface) — DEFERRED
  app-wide-coordinated (~20 field goldens). Next WP candidates: 07 valid + 07/08 validation goldens
  (missing states) — these don't need the field-fill change. Deferred: DECK selector (Future), Note→3
  fields (business), field-fill (app-wide).

### Screen 06 — Flashcard list: DONE (modulo deferred)

All 8 kit states covered. Done: empty/error centered card-wrap (`MxStateCard(centered)`), FlashcardTile
audited (chevron 20 ✓), reorder grip 24→20, search dock built (shared `MxScopedSearchDock`), `_DueBadge`
solid. Remaining deferred: Import-cards button (behavior/no-entry), status chip (needs-schema),
inner-panel 56/22-800 + label 13/600 (needs-token), overline shade (low-value).
See `screen-plans/06-flashcard-list.md`.

### Screen 04 — Folder detail: DONE (modulo deferred)

All 8 kit states covered (6 folder_detail_* goldens + delete-confirm via shared mx_confirm-destructive
+ move-sheet via shared folder_move_picker). Parity done: empty/error card-wrap (MxStateCard), DeckTile
chevron 24→20 + solid due chip, FolderStatsCard value 18→26 + col pad. Remaining = deferred only:
move-sheet full visual (behavior-conflict + needs-schema), DECKS overline shade (low-value), label
13/600 + empty inner-panel + due-chip 11/700 (needs-token), error icon/button (behavior/copy-owned).
See `screen-plans/04-folder-detail.md`.

### Screen 03 — Library overview: DONE (modulo deferred)

WP-1 empty/error card-wrap · WP-2 overflow-sheet golden (6/6 kit states covered) · WP-3 loaded
chevron 24→20 + loaded metrics audited (card/row/tile/typography all match spec). Loaded/loading/
search residual diff is Ahem test-font noise (structurally correct). Remaining = deferred only:
empty inner-panel (56 tile / 22-800 title, needs-token), modal sheet shadow:8/28 (needs-token),
Lucide↔Material icons (accepted). See `screen-plans/03-library-overview.md`.

## Priority order (FE-built first)

03 Library → 04 Folder → 06 Flashcard list → 07/08 editor → 12 Review → 13 Match →
14 Guess → 15 Recall → 16 Fill → 17 Result → other FE screens.

## Cross-screen note (read before judging "missing" nodes)

The kit shots predate the **2026-06-21 IA redesign** (`[[design-redesign-ia-2026-06-21]]`,
`[[fe-loop-complete-mock-authoritative]]`). Some FE nodes are **approved redesign additions**
absent from the kit (e.g. Library's app-bar search toggle + `LibraryRootAnchor`). These are
behavior/nav-owned: classify as intentional deltas, do NOT delete to match the older kit.
Pixel parity work targets nodes the kit and FE BOTH have.
